After all, you&#146;re applying sunscreen and makeup then. But you should save your anti-aging efforts for later in the day. &#147;In the morning it&#146;s about protection; in the evening it&#146;s about reversal and rejuvenation,&#148; says Neil Sadick, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. That&#146;s because many anti-aging products work better at night when your body&#146;s at rest. Plus, cell turnover, when older skin cells shed off and leave skin glowing, increases at night, and certain ingredients take advantage of this biological process. Since overloading your skin with ingredients can irritate it, we&#146;ve rounded up the eight best restorative ones to apply before bed. Alternate days on which you use creams with these ingredients, except where noted.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Retinoic Acid or Retinol</strong></p>\n<p>Retinoids increase collagen production, which helps diminish wrinkles, fine lines and discoloration. But the miracle ingredient is best to use before bedtime, says Ashley Magovern, MD, a board-certified dermatologist for <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dermstore.com</a>. &#147;Retinoids can be degraded by sunlight, and they make you more sensitive to the sun,&#148; she says. Still, you should slather on sunscreen to protect your skin the morning after applying a Retinol cream. Start with a lower-dosage cream, and work up to a prescription-strength one if needed. But know that some women experience irritation from stronger doses, warns Magovern. Try:&#160;<em>Roc Retinol Correxion Eye Cream</em>,&#160;<em>$21.49;&#160;<a href=\"http://www.drugstore.com/roc-retinol-correxion-eye-cream/qxp139555\" target=\"_blank\">Drugstore.com</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong></p>\n<p>Skin loses water when you sleep, and not replenishing it can keep you from looking your best once you wake up. How to stay hydrated? Use a cream that lists water as the first or second ingredient and also has humectants, like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, to lock in moisture. &#147;Be sure to drink water in addition to physically applying cream or washing your face,&#148; suggests Sadick. Or finish your nighttime cleansing process with a toning water spray. Try:&#160;<em>La Roche-Posay Thermal Water Spray, $12.90;&#160;<a href=\"http://www.laroche-posay.us/_us/_en/consumer/catalog/ByType/Dry/laroche-posay-thermal-spring-water.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Laroche-Posay.us</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Alpha Hydroxy Acids</strong></p>\n<p>A major player in any anti-aging arsenal, AHAs, including lactic and glycolic acid, exfoliate the skin and encourage the cell-renewal process. While plenty of day creams include AHAs, Sadick recommends using the ingredient once a week at night because the chemical compounds can be irritating. &#147;But any redness from AHAs will most likely correct itself before you wake up,&#148; he says. Try:&#160;<em>DCL AHA Glycolic Pads, $35;&#160;<a href=\"http://www.skindirect.com/dcl-glycolic-acid-pads-20.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">SkinDirect.com</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong></p>\n<p>This immune-boosting vitamin is good for you in any form, including face cream. Vitamin C helps replenish nutrients and gives stressed skin a boost, but daytime pollutants can render the ingredient ineffective, says Suzanne Owen, owner of Relax & Rejuvenate, a spa at New York City&#146;s Eventi Hotel. &#147;Skin at rest is better able to absorb Vitamin C than skin that&#146;s combating the environment, makeup and sunscreen during the day,&#148; explains Owen. Plus, just as vitamin C in your diet boosts collagen production so does vitamin C in topical form. And collagen smoothes out wrinkles.</p>\n<p><strong>Red or Green Tea</strong></p>\n<p>Tea extracts are some of the best antioxidants to protect skin against pollution and everyday stress. But you&#146;ll get better results in the evening &#147;because skin is relaxed and less exposed to the damaging free radicals [like environmental pollution and ultraviolet rays] present during the day,&#148; says dermatologist Gary Goldfaden. Whether it&#146;s applied as an ingredient in a face cream or simply spritzed in liquid tea form on your face, green or red tea can also soothe tired, swollen eyes on their own&#151;no extra products necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Peptides</strong></p>\n<p>Skin naturally focuses on cell renewal in the evening, and using peptides can further encourage cell turnover, says Owen. They&#146;re also more effective at increasing collagen production at night than during the day, she explains. Why else should you use a peptide cream in the evening instead of the morning? It can leave freshly cleansed skin feeling greasy and be difficult to wear under makeup.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth Factors</strong></p>\n<p>These proteins have been popping up a lot lately, and it&#146;s no wonder: They encourage cell turnover and help skin regenerate and heal. But the ingredient isn&#146;t ideal in daytime creams. &#147;Growth factors can be inactivated by other ingredients [like those found in makeup and sunscreen], so it&#146;s better to use them at night when nothing else is on your skin,&#148; explains dermatologist Debra Jaliman, author of&#160;<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Rules-Trade-Secrets-Dermatologist/dp/1250000955\" target=\"_blank\">Skin Rules</a></em>.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Jojoba Oil</strong></p>\n<p>This ultra-hydrating oil takes hours to absorb, making it too greasy for daytime use. And by the time the next day rolls around, your sagging, tired skin will be refreshed, says Goldfaden. Another reason to wear it while you sleep: Your skin produces less oil at night, making it easier to absorb oil-based products. Even better, jojoba oil won&#146;t clog pores because it doesn&#146;t contain a triglyceride component like other oils.&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-10T13:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"969265","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/2Z/woman-washing-face-pajamas-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Dizik","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mcepeda@hearst.com","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7650542","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-09-10T14:42:30.000Z","author_id":"37951","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-27T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/style-beauty/beauty-tips-products/anti-aging-skin-creams","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Want the key to confidence in 10 simple steps?

Can I do bright lipstick? Will people look at me too much? Will people not look at me enough?<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Our internal conversations are often irrational, but more than likely identical to those of the confident, beautiful girl standing right next to us! So how can we put an end to our body confidence woes?</p>\n<p>We asked Mac makeup artist Sam Bryant, Stylists Grace Woodward and Mariel Haenn, lipstick queen Poppy King and Invisalign ambassador Judi James to give us their top tips on stepping out with your head held high...</p>\n<p>1) Judi James: &#147;Remember the Alice in Wonderland theory: when you wear a new look it becomes exaggerated in your mind, like Alice growing after drinking from the bottle. People actually notice us about a third less than we think, so sadly a lot of people (even the ones you know well) won't even spot your brave new look.&#148;<br /><br />2) Grace Woodward: &#147;When shopping, it&#146;s important to have fun! Try stuff on that you might sometimes pass by because it&#146;s &#145;not you&#146;, it doesn't cost anything. Without experimentation you can never discover anything new!&#148;<br /><br />3) Poppy King: &#147;It can be easier <strong>not</strong> to inject some colour into your makeup, but when you go back to it you realise how much it changes your mood. If you&#146;ve bought a daring lipstick, just wear it around the house until you get used to it.&#148;<br /><br />4) Mariel Haenn: &#147;If you normally stick to black and denim, ease into colour with accessories; so bags, scarves or shoes &#150; these won&#146;t push you too far out of your comfort zone.&#148;<br /><br />5) Judi James: &#147;Stirring music is one of the best prompts of confident thoughts and feelings. Make up a collection of confidence-boosting music and play it on your I-Phone as you get ready in the morning or set off down the road.&#148; <br /><br />6) Grace Woodward: &#147;So few people dress to express themselves and have come to rely on being told what to wear and how to wear it. If you like vertical stripes but have big boobs, who cares! <strong>It&#146;s the smile you wear that&#146;s more important</strong>.&#148;<br /><br />7) Sam Bryant: &#147;A perfect lip line isn&#146;t always the most flattering on bold lips. Diffuse the line with a cotton bud to make your lips look fuller, then pat a bit of extra lipstick into the middle of the mouth so that the most intense colour comes from within the lip.&#148;<br /><br />8) Mariel Haenn &#147;This might seem like an obvious thing to say, but when you get dressed in the morning, always make sure your clothes fit <strong>you</strong> and not just a trend.&#160; Not all trends work for all body types and finding the perfect fit will help you feel immediately more confident.&#148;<br /><br />9) Judi James: &#147;Boost your confidence via your footwear. Our feet have the most constant contact with the ground and really do keep us grounded interms of self-esteem. The shape of the shoe and the balance it provides will affect your intrapersonal signals, i.e. height adds status, and the style and colour of the shoe signals personality.&#148;<br /><br />10) Judi James: &#147;It&#146;s <strong>you</strong> who determines peoples' opinions of you via non-verbal cues. If you keep touching your hair nervously or dropping your head, you'll attract attention while letting everyone know your outfit choice or new hairstyle is a ghastly mistake. Wear it with signals of confidence and people will mirror your thoughts and start to respond with approval. Before you leave the house, pull up to full height, roll your shoulders back and down and relax your facial expression. Breathe out slowly and tell yourself 'I look great.&#146;&#148;</p>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/cosmo/Invisalign/invisalign-logo-200x60.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" align=\"right\" />\nNot feeling confident about your smile?

It was a complete and beautiful surprise. I was at home talking to my mom and I saw on Facebook that someone had posted a link with my song title. I clicked it and though, \"Hey, that looks like<a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/video/justin-bieber-photo-shoot-video-88239338001\" target=\"_self\"> Justin</a>. That looks like <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/celebrity/makeovers/selena-gomez-beauty-makeover\" target=\"_self\">Selena</a>!\" I had just signed the documents for [Justin's label] Schoolboy Records, so it was a nice feeling of welcoming.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> It created a ton of buzz overnight because all the sudden, Justin's 17 million-plus fans knew who you were and heard your song. How has your life changed since this happened?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> It's been really busy, but <em>good</em> busy. I've been working toward this for as long as I can remember.</p>\n<p><strong> 17:</strong> How did you get your start?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> I went to a Canadian college for performing arts and then I auditioned for <em>Canadian Idol</em>. That honestly was my golden ticket. Even though I only placed third, it was enough time on TV and enough exposure. I talked to some of the other contestants about what they had done to be successful after the show and put out my first record, <em>Tug Of War</em>. It got some attention in Canada and won some awards and it kind of just went from there!</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> What is \"Call My Maybe\" about in your words?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> The main inspiration for the song is the idea that there's a kind of chemistry when you meet the right person. There's a spark that needs to be investigated, but it can be left unsaid because sometimes people are too shy to take that step, including myself. I've never actually asked a guy for his number.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> The song is so fun and perfect to play at a slumber party! What are your slumber party must-haves?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> Definitely a comfortable pair of pajama pants, some good girlfriends who know how to laugh at themselves and be silly, and Skittles!</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> What about movies?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> I suggest<em> Pride & Prejudice.</em> It's so fantastic, romantic and Mr. Darcy is, well, my goodness! I'm also really obsessed with Robin's music video \"Call Your Girlfriend\". It's a great music video for a slumber party!</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> Are you working on your album now?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> I have an EP out in Canada, and my album will come out in two months in the States.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> What are some of your other songs about?</p>\n<p><strong>CRJ:</strong> The songs will be similar to \"Call Me Maybe\", but not all of them are going to be totally feel-good.

We sent our worn-out Barbour to its repair centre in South Shields to evaluate the service.</p>\n\n<h2>Rough dealing</h2>\n<p><em>MH</em> staff do their worst on a classic jacket. We then fill out a form at barbour.com detailing the repairs to be made. We take the jacket to an authorised dealer which posts it to the customer services department for free. So far, so very easy.</p>\n\n<h2>Professional help</h2>\n<p>There are 10 specialists in Barbour&#146;s repair department, servicing 13,000 products a year. This highly personalised service means you might not see your jacket for four to six weeks. So don&#146;t plan any deer stalking &#150; or, indeed, stalking of any kind &#150; in the meantime.</p>\n\n<h2>The process</h2>\n<p>First your jacket is inspected (so check for any embarrassing personal effects). Fabric repairs are seen to before reproofing begins. Barbour can match and replace fabrics to a much higher standard than if you tried to get it done at your local dry cleaners.</p>\n\n<h2>Waxon</h2>\n<p>The reproofing table is warmed to 75&#176;C, where wax is sponged over the jacket. The reproofer will try to blend the colours as near as possible &#150; there will be a slight difference but it adds character. The jacket is hung on a rail to dry for 24 hours, then returned to you.</p>\n\n<h2>Our verdict</h2>\n<p>The jacket arrives back restored to its former glory. Our rips to the lining, outer layer and rewaxing came in at just &#163;76, comparing favourably to the cost of buying a new one. If only your country pile was so easy to maintain.</p>\n\n<h2>The DIY approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Step one</strong> You need a tin of Barbour's Thornproof wax (&#163;7, <a href=\"http://www.numbersixlondon.com/barbour-thornproof-wax-dressing\" target=\"_blank\">numbersixlondon.comk</a>), a pan of hot water to boil it in, a bowl of iced water, a sponge, a cloth and a hairdryer.</p>\n<p><strong>Step two</strong> Reproof in a warm room or outside on a hot day. Clean the jacket with the sponge and ice water. Open the wax and boil in hot water until melted (still in its tin).</p>\n<p><strong>Step three</strong> Use the cloth  to carefully work the wax into the jacket. When finished, hang it up and dry it with a hairdryer. This re-melts the wax for an even, glossy finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Step four</strong> Let your jacket dry for 24 hours; then quarantine it. It will bleed wax for a week or two so be sure to keep it away from any delicate fabrics.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><font size=\"1\">Photography: Aaron Tilley<br />Words: Ryan Thompson</font></em></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-08-06T10:40:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7037833","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":"Apil '12  p163","print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-06T10:45:00.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-02T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/style/tips/its-a-wax-miracle","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"We built three tiny cottages, bursting at the seams with small-space decorating ideas.

constantly arguing with your husband doesn&#146;t make for a happy marriage, your relationship can suffer as badly if you hold back feelings until you finally explode. &#147;We go from being passive to being aggressive, when it&#146;s optimal to be assertive,&#148; says Elizabeth Lombardo, PhD, author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Happy-You-Ultimate-Prescription-Happiness/dp/1600375324\" target=\"_blank\">A Happy You: Your Ultimate Prescription for Happiness</a></em>. And there are certain subjects that are best to address as soon as possible. Here, experts share their thoughts on nine fights worth starting&#151;and why doing so can actually improve your marriage.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You're too obsessed with your phone/iPad.&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>After a long day, you want to catch up with your husband&#151;not compete with Angry Birds or whoever&#146;s texting him for his attention. &#147;Energy spent on your phone is energy that&#146;s not being put into the relationship,&#148; says Alisa Bowman, author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Project-Happily-Marriage-Fairytale-Falters/dp/B006CDDI9E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1331865975&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Project: Happily Ever After</a></em><em>. </em>Rather than roll your eyes when he whips out his cell, start a conversation. Try: &#147;If we&#146;re talking and you take a phone call, I feel like I don&#146;t matter to you,&#148; suggests Laurie Puhn, couples mediator and author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fight-Less-Love-More-Conversations/dp/B0062GK4YI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1331865948&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Fight Less, Love More: 5-Minute Conversations to Change Your Relationship without Blowing Up or Giving In</a></em>.</p>\n<p>After that, come up with ground rules about disconnecting, whether it&#146;s during meals together or for an hour each night. And stick with that plan. If he slips up, which he will at first, Puhn recommends saying something like: &#147;Was that text important, or did you just forget our new rule?&#160;In that case, a foot massage is in order!&#148; If your mate isn&#146;t following the guidelines at all, sit down and re-discuss what works for you, she says.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;I feel like it's all on me, all the time.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Besides growing exhausted from doing every chore on your own, you may also begin to feel like your hubby doesn&#146;t care about you if he doesn&#146;t chip in. But that&#146;s not how he sees it. &#147;Men process things in different ways. Women put the burden on themselves and personalize things,&#148; says Lombardo.</p>\n<p>If you&#146;re feeling unsupported, say something before you start resenting your spouse. Speaking up did wonders for DeVonne of Bowie, MD. The working mom of twins reached her boiling point when she realized she was on the go from 5:00 a.m. until 10 p.m. &#147;I told my husband, &#145;I&#146;m a super mommy, but I need to take off my cape sometimes&#151;you need to help out more,&#146;&#148; she says. After a little yelling and some tears, her husband does everything she does around the house and with their twins.</p>\n<p>Start the discussion when stress levels are low, advises Lombardo. And be specific about your needs. Try: &#147;It would help me if you handle these three things each week without me asking.&#148; Also, adds Lombardo, point out what&#146;s in it for him: a happier, more energetic wife. Just know, however, that sometimes you will have to make requests if he forgets. &#147;Assertively but kindly ask, &#145;Honey, could you empty the dishwasher?&#146;&#148; suggests Bowman. &#147;We don&#146;t think we should have to make these simple requests. In reality, though, some spouses need a nudge.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You need to see a doctor.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Jenny of Powder Springs, GA, grew tired of her husband&#146;s complaints about headaches and arm numbness because he refused to visit a doctor. She even jokingly suggested she increase his life insurance policy! She finally got him to change his ways with help from family&#151;she and his parents together convinced him to get checked out. The diagnosis: high blood pressure. &#147;Now he&#146;s on medication and doing much better. No more headaches!&#148; says Jenny.</p>\n<p>Your first step: Try to figure out the source of your hubby&#146;s doctor-avoidance, says Puhn. &#147;People often ignore health concerns because they don&#146;t know what to do if they get bad news.&#160;Ask if that&#146;s the problem, and then research treatments for the ailments your mate fears the most,&#148; she suggests. &#147;The fact that there are ways to solve health problems could persuade him to go to the doctor.&#148;</p>\n<p>Then, make it clear to your hubby that you&#146;re picking this fight for his well-being, not because he&#146;d look better if he lost a few pounds, for instance. Compliments won&#146;t hurt either. When you bring this up, focus on how much you need, love and care about him and want him to stick around for the long haul. How could he argue with that?</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;Don't undermine my authority in front of the kids.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>It&#146;s tough to be taken seriously when your children witness Dad overruling one of your decisions. It could be as innocent as him giving your son a few extra minutes playing his video game (after you&#146;ve told him to power down), but if done repeatedly, the kids will catch on. Try: &#147;Our children know they can get away with stuff. Let&#146;s get on the same page,&#148; advises Lombardo.</p>\n<p>Put it out there that if one of you makes a decision, the other parent must uphold it. You can discuss differing parenting styles when the kids aren&#146;t there, but in front of them, stand united. When one of you isn&#146;t around to check with the other, try to hold out on offering a decision, suggests Puhn. &#147;Whether it&#146;s how late a teen can stay out or how much money to give her, don&#146;t cave just because your child wants an answer immediately.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You spend too much money.&#148; Or &#147;You&#146;re too cheap.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Before you get into a spending spat, think about your spouse&#146;s motivations. According to Lombardo, &#147;a spender may want to enjoy their hard work, while a saver wants to feel safe.&#148; Still, whatever money matter is important to you, don&#146;t keep it bottled up.</p>\n<p>*Monica from Detroit, MI, says her husband still thanks her for picking a fight about purchasing long-term-care insurance years ago. &#147;He thought it was too expensive. Ten years later, the prices have exploded and the generous policy we bought then isn't offered anymore,&#148; she says. How did she convince him? She compared the costs of not having insurance (like what nursing homes may charge decades from now) to having it. Buying insurance turned out to be the smarter spending strategy. So when a purchase is necessary or can save you more money in the long run, lay out that argument as Monica did.</p>\n<p>While you shouldn&#146;t waste energy on money spent or saved in the past, make a rule for the future, advises Puhn. &#147;Maybe you&#146;re both free to spend what you want up to a certain amount or from a specific account, and beyond that you must consult your partner,&#148; she says.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You work all the time.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Especially in a tough job market, your husband may be putting in extra hours to stay in his boss&#146;s good graces. Or maybe he simply enjoys his work. Whatever the case, you barely see him and you&#146;re feeling lonely. &#147;You&#146;re not getting what you need, but he thinks he&#146;s being the perfect husband by providing,&#148; says Bowman.</p>\n<p>But saying &#147;stop working so much&#148; won&#146;t work. He&#146;ll hear &#147;you don&#146;t respect what I&#146;m doing or how hard I&#146;m working,&#148; explains Lombardo. Instead, emphasize that you miss him and come up with ways to spend more time together, she suggests. Maybe you can wake up earlier some mornings to have coffee with each other, schedule a standing date night (even if he has to return to work after) or meet at the gym for a joint workout.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You can&#146;t let your family/friends treat me like that!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>It&#146;s inevitable that an in-law or one of your hubby&#146;s buddies will offend at some point, and your partner&#146;s failure to defend you might leave you fuming. But here&#146;s the thing: Your husband may not even know why you&#146;re mad, says Lombardo. &#147;Sit him down, take a deep breath and say: &#145;Here&#146;s what happened and here&#146;s why it upset me. What can we do about it?&#146;&#148;</p>\n<p>But don&#146;t hold your partner accountable for others&#146; actions, just as you wouldn&#146;t want to be on the hook for something your mom or best friend did. Instead, discuss how you can eliminate the potential for problems in the future. For instance, when he hangs out with his old college roommate (the one you can&#146;t stand), have alternate plans for yourself. Or the next time his mom criticizes your parenting in front of the whole family, he&#146;ll speak to her about it privately.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You&#146;re constantly complaining.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone has the occasional bad day, but if your ranting hubby is frequently sucking the joy out of your time together, get his complaining in check. That&#146;s what *Michelle from Oregon had to do after her husband groused about little things on a family trip, like stepping off the airport security line so their son could finish a drink he couldn&#146;t take to the gate. Michelle confronted him about the behavior, and they both acknowledged that he was struggling with separating his intense business trips from laid-back getaways. &#147;Now I remind him to make a mental change from work travel mode to fun vacation mode when we take family trips,&#148; says Michelle.</p>\n<p>When your husband complains, be a good listener, but only for a few minutes, says Bowman. He may not realize he&#146;s being a downer, so after he has his say, point out the bright side and then tell him it&#146;s time to switch gears, she suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>The fight: &#147;You only show affection when you want to fool around.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;The interpretation is he&#146;s using you for your body,&#148; says Lombardo, even though that&#146;s likely not the case. He married you, after all! Without consistent affection, though, a woman might not feel consistently loved. Not to mention, his sex-driven moves will end up leading to less intimacy, says Bowman. &#147;When you see him coming, you may tense up, which kills the<em> </em>mood,&#148; she explains.</p>\n<p>The solution: Designate some nights as sex-free ones, during which it&#146;s his job to still give affection, but with no strings attached, suggests Bowman. Lombardo adds that women need to be vocal about their need for a physical connection outside of the bedroom. &#147;Tell him, &#145;When you hold my hand or hug me, it reminds me you love me,&#146;&#148; she recommends.</p>\n<p>*Names changed</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-07-09T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"968187","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/Qq/husband-wife-couple-fighting-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Papandrea","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mvanderburg","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7563673","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-01-17T18:48:41.000Z","author_id":"37851","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-23T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/dating-marriage/how-to-fight-with-your-husband","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Why do I have to repeat something five times before my husband responds?","site_id":"29","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"men, relationships, husband, when men don't listen","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Dear Whys Guy: Why Don't Men Listen?","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-07-08T23:23:07.000Z","headline_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/AG/whys-guy-0712-smn.jpg","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love-sex/love-signs","link_text":"Decoding Men's Oddball Love Signals"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love-sex/advice/infidelity/cheating-websites","link_text":"\"I Went Undercover on America's Cheating Website\""},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fun-contests/giada-de-laurentiis-interview-on-men-and-husband","link_text":"Giada De Laurentiis on Men , Trust, and Tabloid Lies"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love-sex/advice/healthy-relationships/why-he-cant-hear","link_text":"Why Can't He Hear What You're Saying?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love-sex/advice/infidelity/would-guy-cheat","link_text":"Would Your Guy Cheat?

I need to focus! If you want us to listen on the first attempt, catch us at a moment when we look at peace with the world--and the TV isn't on.

Finally, a voice echoes in the darkness: \"Can anyone hear me?\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nI let out a muffled \"help\" as I strain to see through a gap in the dusty rubble. Outside is more darkness, blowing smoke, and, 20 yards away, the promising beams of headlamps. \"Help,\" I shout again. \"Over here.\" \n\n<br /><br /> \n\n\"Ma'am, we'll be right there. We're coming,\" a young female voice bellows back in the dark. \"Is there anyone with you?\" \n\n<br /><br /> \n\n\"One, one more,\" I scream. Sprawled out next to me in the dirt is a lifeless body, both legs twisted beneath it at impossible angles. In the distance, the sound of voices grows louder, along with the growl of jackhammers and the crack of metal bludgeoning rock.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"All quiet,\" a voice suddenly cries out. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"All quiet,\" a chorus of several dozen repeats back in unison. Then, perfect calm. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Ma'am, can you still hear us?\" the young woman yells again, more clearly in the surrounding silence. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"My sister,\" I cry. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Is your sister still alive?\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"I don't know,\" I scream. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"All right. Stay calm,\" she yells. \"Ma'am, we're with the U.S. Army Reserve. We're here to help. We're on our way!\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>The smoke, the dust, and the screams are real</strong></span>, but my sister is actually a vinyl dummy; my rubble cave, part of a complex set. I'm at the Center for National Response (CNR) in Gallagher, W.Va., where rescuers train to respond to domestic disasters inside an abandoned highway tunnel. A wide array of trainees&#151;from National Guard, Coast Guard, and Air Force teams to police officers, EMTs, and firefighters&#151;use the unique facility to learn to battle situations as diverse as earthquakes, terrorist bombings, train derailments, and highway accidents. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nToday's students are military, members of the Army's 300th Chemical Company. I've spent the past few days watching them train under the direction of Dave Underwood, a tall, even-tempered former fire captain. Soldiers like these probably won't be first on the scene in a big disaster, Underwood says, but they'll provide the manpower and equipment to push on after the capability of local civilian first responders has been exhausted. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhile the military has dozens of specialized training grounds nationwide, none is as versatile as the CNR for preparing specifically for domestic catastrophes. During my time there, several people refer to the facility as \"a Disneyland for first responders.\" The site includes 10,000 acres of dense woodland that hide a mock meth lab and a couple of rusty single-engine airplanes used to create crash scenarios. There's a crowded lot full of trashed cars and trucks and a mountain of concrete blocks and rebar, all of it tools for the center's dozen trainers. The CNR's most valuable training ground, though, is the tunnel. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nChiseled into a mountain face in West Virginia coal country 60 years ago, the Memorial Tunnel was abandoned in the late 1980s when a new interstate was built nearby. In 2000, the property was acquired by the West Virginia National Guard and then converted into a multifaceted training facility with a staff that also takes its disaster-planning skills on the road. Today, the tunnel contains a mock train platform, several more illicit drug labs, a highway pileup involving a jackknifed big rig, a meandering plaster cave built to resemble mountain hide-outs in Afghanistan, and the only two subway cars in the state.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAt the far end of the tunnel is the hulking pile of concrete where I've voluntarily trapped myself. Smoke machines and the same massive fans that served the original tunnel blow damp waves of dusty air while dimmable lights force the rescuers to work in near darkness. It is cold and desolate. Though I can see groups of trainees slowly moving toward me from the front end of the pile, behind me is nothing but mountains of rubble strewn with mangled bodies. It's a carefully constructed landscape. \"We can create any light setting that they want,\" Underwood says. \"We can make wind. We can smoke the tunnel or put flame bars out. We can give them the realism that they need.\" Many of these soldiers have yet to see a war zone, never mind a major domestic disaster. The goal of the tunnel training is to get them as ready as possible for the real thing.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/survival/stories/preparing-for-disaster-at-first-responders-boot-camp-7588642-2\">CONTINUED >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Vg/disaster-training-02-0612-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-05T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Thompson","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7588642","related_links":"<a href=\"/outdoors/from-bystander-to-hero\">From Bystander to Hero: How to be the First Responder to 10 Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/environment/natural-disasters/3852052\">5 Natural Disasters Headed for the United States</a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/preparing-for-disaster-at-first-responders-boot-camp-7588642\">Preparing for Disaster at First Responders Boot Camp</a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/10-disasters\">The 10 Worst Disasters of the Last Century</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4219953\">10 Worst Disasters of the Last 101 Years: Discussion Forum</a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/japan-tsunami-updates\">One Year Later: The Legacy of Japan&rsquo;s Tsunami and Nuclear Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/extreme-building-codes\">Extreme Building Codes: Protect Your Home From Natural Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/4-things-to-know-about-maritime-disasters-6640490\">4 Things to Know About Maritime Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/home-how-to-tips\">30 Quick Fixes and Tips for Everyday Home Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/environment/natural-disasters/4322095\">RubbleViewer Uses Robots to Map Natural Disasters in 3D</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:20:19.000Z","author_id":"5767","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/survival/stories/preparing-for-disaster-at-first-responders-boot-camp-7588642","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"According to a new report, tattoo removal is on the rise&#151;big time.

We're talking 32 percent over last year, with many pointing the finger at the high unemployment rate.\n\n<br /><br /> \n\nCurious to know tat removal is like, we contacted dermatologist Jeffrey Rand, MD, founder of Dr. Rand&#146;s Tattoo Removal Center, for details.\n<br /><br /> \n\nNo one can guarantee that the <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/exclusive/celeb-tattoos#slide-1\" target=\"_blank\">entire tat</a> will be removed, Rand says, but many are completely erased or 90 to 95 percent gone by the end.\n<br /><br /> \nIn each session, a derm will use a laser to break down the ink with beams of light. The amount of pain you feel will depend on your skin sensitivity and the type of laser they use, but Rand says you should only feel something that&#146;s similar to a rubber band snapping against your skin. If you still feel uncomfortable&#151;itchy, swollen, or sore&#151;after an appointment, an ice pack should relieve the pain.\n<br /><br /> \nRand says blistering happens occasionally, although red ink is the most susceptible to it. Most of the time, though, your tattoo just looks whiter right after a session, but the color change is temporary.\n \n<br /><br />\nWant to remove your tat? Rand recommends taking a pass on medical spas and looking for a dermatologist in your area who specializes in tattoo removal or at least does it more than once a month. \n\n<br /><br /> \n\nDo you regret getting a tattoo?\n<br /><br /> "}],"blog_author":"Korin Miller"}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-06-01T18:13:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Miller","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kmiller","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7211138","related_links":"<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/celebrity-tattoos\">Celebrity Tattoos That Shouldn't Have Happened</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hairstyles-beauty/how-to/beauty_qa_hair_removal\">Beauty Q&amp;A : Hair Removal and Maintenance</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/sexual-health/tattoo-std\">Sexual Health: I just got a tattoo .

He pulls back on the controls and just keeps pulling. When the helo's nose rears up, I feel my body sinking into the seat as my heart crawls up my esophagus. We keep going until all I see is blue sky, then the line that separates it from the greener blue of the gulf. A little voice in my head is saying <em>huuuunh?</em> and the weight of an implausible yet true realization sweeps over me: The rotors are now below us, the landing skids above. We are flying upside down.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere's a reason why you should never, ever fly upside down in a helicopter: The rotors will bend toward the skids and cut off the tail and you'll plummet to your death. Helicopter rotors are designed to handle a lot of flexion, because each blade has to bend up and down as it moves into and against the slipstream. In normal flight, the blades bend away from the cockpit. But if you fly upside down, they flex in the other direction, giving a whole new meaning to the word chopper.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAaron, a 63-year-old with a mane of golden hair and a bushy mustache fit for a circus ringmaster, knows all about this. He was a helicopter pilot and mechanic living in Camarillo, Calif., when he got a call from Red Bull in 2004. They'd heard that he'd assembled a U.S. Army attack helicopter from parts scrounged on the open market. They asked him: Could he build a helicopter capable of looping the loop? \"No,\" he told them. It was impossible. End of story.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut Aaron kept mulling it over, and he thought that if you took the right kind of helicopter and modified it in just the right way, you might wind up with an aircraft that could fly upside down. Red Bull gave him the money, and he bought a pair of German BO-105 helicopters with rugged one-piece titanium rotor heads and four short, stiff composite blades. After a year of modifications&#151;he refuses to reveal the engineering details&#151;he took his helo up. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nSuccess did not come easily. For three months Aaron got to know the machine, testing its capabilities. But fear held him back. \"I'd get vertical and I'd chicken out,\" he says. \"But over time I kept going a little bit farther, and one day I pulled that sucker up and as I got to my chicken point, I did one of those instant things where I said, 'I'm going for it.' I pulled it straight back and I did the loop. As soon as I saw the ground I was like, 'I can get this!' So I pulled out of that and I did it again. I didn't want to forget how I did it. So I did it again and again&#151;10 times.\" From that first loop he expanded his repertoire of maneuvers, and today he's the only civilian pilot in the U.S. licensed to perform aerobatics in a helicopter.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIt's a cold morning in Pensacola, Fla., when I meet up with Aaron. A big air show starts tomorrow, and with the 20-mph winds, Aaron is debating whether to take part in the rehearsal. One time, he tells me, he almost killed himself trying to perform under similar conditions. This gives me pause, but Aaron assures me that we'll be fine if we go out over the water and try a few maneuvers. So up we go.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe launch from the Naval Air Station's ramp and pass over the beach. Aaron climbs until he's above the barrier island that he'll use as a reference line to orient himself. Then he pulls up into the loop. In a matter of seconds we're over the top, then arcing downward. Aaron has discovered that this can be the most dangerous part. \"If I keep it pointed down for too long, I'll build up too much airspeed,\" he says. \"Then I'll have too many g's in the pullout and rip the transmission off.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThat doesn't happen today, I'm pleased to report. Aaron once again pulls up into a climb, then startles me by rolling over to the left until our bodies are parallel to the horizon. He keeps rolling until we're upside down, then brings us back up the other side. In a plane, the equivalent maneuver would be a mild trick called an aileron roll; in a helicopter, the procedure causes a disconcerting sensation, as if someone were holding you by your heels over the edge of a tall building.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNext, Aaron pulls back on the stick and waits for his airspeed to bleed off until we're nearly dead in the air. Then he pushes the stick forward. We're floating in our seats in a low-altitude approximation of NASA's Vomit Comet. A second later we're toppling forward. As we fall straight down Aaron rotates us 180 degrees on a vertical axis so our track is like the stripe on a barber pole, then pulls back so we level out.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAaron keeps stringing together one maneuver after another: up, sideways, down&#151;<em>whoop!</em> I'm starting to think about a barf bag as Aaron pulls out of a climb and turns us into the wind. He's about to unleash the ultimate.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Zero airspeed,\" he says, gesturing at the instrument panel. \"This is the back flip.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nHe pulls back, and back, and back. I briefly have the sensation of climbing as the windshield fills with blue, and then the uncomfortable feeling of toppling backward, falling upside down, hanging in my straps, a blur of disorientation. The helicopter has pivoted, heels over head, from a standstill&#151;like a swimmer doing a back flip off a diving board. Then we're right side up again, barreling toward the shore below. My ears are filled with a piercing scream. It's coming from my own throat. It's a scream of pure, blind, mindless joy. \n\n<br /><br

But if your workplace offers a 401(k) retirement savings plan, you should absolutely be taking advantage of it. 'The money you save today will be how you maintain your lifestyle once you retire,' says Beth Kobliner, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Get-Financial-Life-Personal-Twenties/dp/0743264363/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332961285&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Get a Financial Life</em> </a>and member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability. It's not difficult to get started, and every $1 you invest in your 40s could double by the time you're 65. (Invest that $1 in your 30s and it could be worth $5 by retirement time; in your 20s, that dollar could be worth $10!) Here's how to make the most of a 401(k).</p>\n<p><strong>Determine your risk level</strong></p>\n<p>Before you invest in anything, you need to decide how risky you want to be with your money. Are you willing to take more risk for a potentially bigger payout or is slow and steady more your speed? Go to Vanguard's Investor Questionnaire (<a href=\"http://www.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire\" target=\"_blank\">Personal.Vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire</a>) or see if the company administering your employer's 401(k) offers a risk survey, suggests Kobliner. \"The results will reveal your comfort level with investing in stocks (which are riskier) versus bonds (more conservative). The closer you are to retirement, the more cautious you should be, since you'll need the money sooner. Risk surveys will take that into account when suggesting the right mix for you,\" she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider prepackaged</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of 401(k) plans offer something called target date funds. These are a prepackaged mix of investments based on your expected retirement date, designed to automatically adjust investments (and risk) as the years go by. You just give your expected retirement date, and the corresponding fund is chosen. Done!</p>\n<p>If you'd rather not use a prepackaged fund, go to Financial Engines (<a href=\"http://www.financialengines.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FinancialEngines.com</a>), which can help you figure out the best investment mix using info you provide (age, expected retirement date, savings rate, etc.). A subscription to the site costs $39.95 for a three-month period, but before you sign up, talk to your employer's human resources manager, since many employers offer access to Financial Engines for free.</p>\n<p><strong>Get your match </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>If your company offers 401(k) matching, they're guaranteeing that they'll give you a certain percentage of your con- tributions, such as 50&#162; for every dollar you invest. That's free money, Kobliner points out.</p>\n<p>(Companies generally match anywhere from 1% to 6% of your salary.) So say your annual salary is $50,000 and you contribute 6% ($3,000) to your 401(k) plan. If your company match is 50%, that means they'll give you $1,500. Though some companies paused their match a few years ago due to the economic downturn, 74% have since reinstated it, according to a recent study by Towers Watson, a human resources consulting firm.</p>\n<p><strong>Up the amount </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>First things first: Figure out how much you'll need to retire-basically, what you'll need to maintain your current standard of living once you stop working. A great place to figure out the number? Moneychimp (<a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/401k_calculator.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MoneyChimp.com/features/401k_calculator.htm</a>). Once you know the end goal, consider how much you'll want to increase your contribution amount regularly, says Scott Holsopple, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.smart401k.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart401K.com</a>, a website dedicated to 401(k) knowledge. \"Some plans allow you to set up automatic increases based on dates you choose,\" he says. If that's not an option in your plan, set up calendar reminders to increase your contributions annually on your anniversary, birthday or when you get a raise.</p>\n<p><strong>Be aware of fees</strong></p>\n<p>Your 401(k) is not free. The company that runs your 401(k) charges you for the services they provide-usually around 1% to 1.5% of your balance annually, says Holsopple. Certain funds have higher fees, and the more services you use (such as specialty products like target date funds), the more you pay.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing: Up to now, it was hard to know how much was being taken out because the fees were rarely broken down on statements. \"But thanks to a federal rule, starting later this year, plan providers have to start offering 401(k) savers more detailed information about the fees and expenses associated with their plans,\" says Kobliner.</p>\n<p>Keep fees to a minimum by asking your account manager how much you're paying for certain funds and whether or not you should switch. Fund fees can range from less than 1% to 2% or higher. A difference of 1% may not sound like a lot, but over the long term it can take a chunk out of your returns.</p>\n<p>A Department of Labor analysis found that paying an extra 1% on an investment over a 35-year period could decrease your total balance at retirement age by as much as 28%. In other words, an account that should be worth $50,000 could actually be worth $36,000!</p>\n<p><strong>Move the money with you </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>If you leave your job, you're technically allowed to leave your 401(k) in the account you've been using, as long as you have at least $5,000 in your account. \"But I recommend rolling your old 401(k) directly into a 401(k) with your new company (if you're still working) so that you can continue to make contributions and take advantage of the match at your new company,\" says Kobliner.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't cash out early </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Need some cash to pay your mortgage in a tight month, or is your kids' college tuition coming up? \"My mantra: Stay away from your 401(k)!\" says Kobliner. If you withdraw from your 401(k) before age 59&#189;-for whatever reason-you'll likely pay a 10% penalty plus taxes. So that $10,000 withdrawal actually ends up being worth only about $6,000 or $7,000. These days, you can most likely get a bank loan with better terms than that.</p>\n<p>CARI WIRA DINEEN is a freelance writer who lives in New Jersey.</p>\n<p><strong><em>When the market drops, don't panic! </em></strong></p>\n<p>Those who stayed the course and kept their investments constant during the recent economic downturn have seen their 401(k) account balances increase by 50%.

Its sports scientists have engineered new ways of training and perfected athletes&#146; recovery, psychology and injury prevention to maximise their chances of gold this summer. Today we bring you exclusive access to their training methods, as elite-level informants give you eyes on their fitness dossiers for all you need to perform at your best. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/olympic-cyclist-secrets-2903.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Warm up in your sleep</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Simon Drane, EIS performance psychologist working with GB badminton</strong> <br />&#147;Just like a pre-performance routine, a pre-sleep routine and good &#145;sleep hygiene&#146; helps an athlete achieve optimal sleeping state,&#148; Drane says. This &#145;sleep warm-up&#146; will result in you falling asleep within 10 minutes of your head hitting the pillow, so you wake up with maximum energy and your muscles restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Minus 3 hours</strong> Set up a conducive sleeping environment by removing digital devices from view in your bedroom. Set aside a drawer to keep your phone, tablet or laptop so that there&#146;s no urge to access them before bed.</p>\n<p><strong>Minus 30 minutes</strong> The most important aspect of sleep hygiene is to be able to turn-off from the day&#146;s activities and slow the functioning of your brain down to prepare your body and mind for a good night&#146;s rest. Dim the lights and find a routine in which you can do everything slowly: read at a measured pace, steadily tidy your room or meticulously pack a bag for the morning. Steady body equals sleepy mind.</p>\n<h2>Back-up your punch</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Ian Pyper, EIS strength and conditioning coach, GB boxing</strong> <br />The pulling muscles in your back act as crucial support for the <a title=\"Brad PIckett on striking\" href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/sports-training/brad-picketts-ufc-blog-striking\" target=\"_blank\">punching power</a> generated by your legs, arms and shoulders. &#147;Look at it this way,&#148; says Pyper. &#147;If I gave you a Ferrari, you&#146;d want to drive it as fast as you could. But If I gave you a Ferrari with faulty brakes, you&#146;d have to drive it cautiously.&#148;</p>\n<p>Likewise, if a boxer&#146;s upper back muscles aren&#146;t strong enough to match the arm he&#146;s punching with, his body will instinctively protect itself &#150; and throw a weaker punch as a result. That&#146;s why it&#146;s important for you to condition every muscle group to create a rock solid power chain capable of delivering knock-out blows.</p>\n<p>&#147;The force originates at ground level and works up through your body,&#148; Pyper says. He recommends a leg press with double your own bodyweight to build power from the bottom.</p>\n<p>Then use the routine below to ensure your punch, tackle, throw or tennis serve has the appropriate back-up. Your collateral on this case: a V-shaped torso.</p>\n<p><br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/boxing-workout-2903.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>A: Weighted pull-up (3 x 6 reps)</strong> <br />Using a weighted dip belt or holding a dumbbell between your ankles, grab a pull-up bar with an overhand grip. Pull up until your chin is above the bar, then lower yourself slowly and repeat. Rest for 60 seconds between sets.</p>\n<p><strong>B: Bent-over row (3 x 8 reps)</strong> <br />Grab a barbell and hold it using an overhand grip, with your back straight and held at an angle of about 45 degrees. Raise the bar to your stomach, then return and repeat. Soon you&#146;ll be ready to swing for victory. Rest for 60 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>C: Iron cross (5 x 30 seconds)</strong> <br />Holding a heavy dumbbell in each hand, extend both arms out to the sides at shoulder height so that your body forms a T-shape. Maintain the position for 30 seconds to strengthen your traps and build powerful shoulders.</p>\n<h2>Build explosive strength and agility</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Rhys Ingram, EIS strength and conditioning coach for British fencing</strong> <br />Great power can come from nothing more than a single leg. &#147;Fencers, like boxers, generate immense power, moving very quickly from a relaxed position,&#148; says Ingram. &#147;Building elasticity with single-leg moves gives you that explosive strength and helps you to absorb impacts when you land.&#148;</p>\n<p>To increase this elastic benefit, the key exercises are long lunges and reverse lunges.&#148; These will improve your agility and strength in any sport. &#147;Move into the lunge by letting your hips drop before you explode forwards,&#148; Ingram says. &#147;Keep your chest forward and head up, focusing on a point in front of you. This helps to transfer power from your lower to your upper body and takes advantage of the elasticity in your physique.&#148; Do 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg, and spring into action.</p>\n<h2>Twice the leg power</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Paul Barratt, EIS biomechanist for the British cycling team</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/25-degrees-2903.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><br />This number is critical to generating more speed on your bike. &#147;Adjust your saddle so that the angle at your knee joint is 25 degrees at the bottom of your pedal stroke. This increases your power and efficiency, while reducing your risk of injury,&#148; says Barratt. In other words, you&#146;ll uncover new pace and endurance.</p>\n<h2>Use squats to build universal power</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Martin Evans, EIS strength and conditioning coach for British cycling</strong> <br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/squat-workout-2903.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Speed in any sport is entirely determined by how much power you can produce. What few amateurs realise, says Evans, is that a lot of that power comes from your hips, and squats are the best way to increase this. &#147;Athletes produce more force when the muscles in their hips are in an open position,&#148; Evans says. &#147;I use the squatting patterns above with our athletes to sustain that power output.&#148;</p>\n<h2>Painless running</h2>\n<p><strong>Informant: Jamal Mashlab, EIS physiotherapist</strong> <br />&#147;Stand in front of a mirror and raise one knee,&#148; Mashlab says. &#147;Now look at the opposite hip &#150; if your pelvis has dropped then your glute on that side is weak and you run the risk of a <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/sports-injuries/injury-2-the-hamstring-tea\" target=\"_blank\">hamstring injury</a>.&#148; Use lunges, clamshells and resistance-band exercises to correct this. Then further strengthen your hamstrings with the single-leg waiter&#146;s bow. From a standing position, lean forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and raising one leg behind you. When you reach about 45 degrees, return to the start position and swap legs. Do 10 reps on each leg, and run free.</p>\n<p><br /><em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Photography Getty, Digital Imaging Pre Media; Illustrations: Jason Pickersgill @ Acute Graphics<br />Words: Ian Taylor, Sue Mott</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></span></p>","article_type_name":"Open Format Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-05-21T06:31:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"22003","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7698164","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":"May '12 p62","print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1089","last_updated_date":"2012-05-22T09:04:47.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-29T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/cardio-exercise/olympic-fitness-screts","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Learn how you can prevent weight gain, hot flashes and more","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"hot flashes, health tips, aging, menopause","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Ease the Symptoms of Aging","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-14T15:16:27.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/take-charge-of-menopause-123270","link_text":"Take Charge of Menopause"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/9-things-you-should-ask-your-gynecologist-101954","link_text":"9 Things You Should Ask Your Gynecologist"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/10-things-i-didnt-know-about-menopause-104008","link_text":"10 Things I Didn&rsquo;t Know About Menopause"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/will-you-experience-menopause-like-your-mom-104873","link_text":"Will You Experience Menopause Like Your Mom?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/dealing-premature-menopause-70436","link_text":"Dealing with Premature Menopause"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/the-truth-about-sex-after-menopause-99603","link_text":"The Truth about Sex after Menopause"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/do-hormones-work-for-menopause-123295","link_text":"Do Hormones Work for Menopause ?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/does-soy-help-relieve-hot-flashes-83516","link_text":"Does Soy Help Relieve Hot Flashes ?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/8-menopause-misconceptionsexplained-123276","link_text":"8 Menopause Misconceptions&mdash;Explained"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/health-musts-for-every-decade-104678","link_text":"Health Musts for Every Decade"}],"author_first_name":"Leslie","source_id":"1","teaser":"Learn how you can prevent weight gain, hot flashes and more","origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":"Learn how you can prevent weight gain, hot flashes and more","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"ease-symptoms-of-aging","description":"Learn how you can prevent weight gain, hot flashes and more","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-03-23T16:07:33.000Z","title":"Ease Symptoms of Aging","custom_canonical":null,"allow_comment":"1","meta_title":"Anti-Aging Health -

I'm standing right outside, and I need to call Ema to verify I'm in the right place because there's no sign indicating that this nondescript Los Angeles industrial building houses the world's premier Duesenberg restoration shop. When you're working on cars that sell for millions of dollars, discretion is the order of the day.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nEma belongs to a rare sect of mechanical specialists whose passion is devoted to a single esoteric vehicle. Most mechanics are generalists, but a handful of gearheads catch a fever for a particular machine out on the fringe and cultivate their expertise and resources until they become The Guy for that car. Temples of automotive obsession exist all over the country, populated by diehards who stoke the fire for Lancias or Studebakers or Mercedes-Benz Pullman limos. Ema's shop is my embarkation point for a 1200-mile pilgrimage up the West Coast to meet some of these characters and learn exactly how one becomes a nationally recognized authority on Duesenbergs, or the DeLorean DMC-12, or a GMC motorhome produced for five years in the 1970s. Because that last one in particular seems like a career path your high school guidance counselor most certainly would have recommended against.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIf you're going to visit artisans of quirky and anachronistic auto engineering, you need an appropriately contrarian vehicle, so I borrowed a 2011 Mazda RX-8 for the trip. Mazda will halt production of the RX-8 after this model year, making it the last car to use a rotary engine. So if you own one of these Mazdas in 2032, you'll need to know someone who speaks the language of rotors and ports instead of pistons and valves. You'll need The Guy. But before you can enlist the help of one of these automotive shamans, you'll need to find him.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>The Duesy Doctor</strong></h3><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/zi/brotherhood-of-the-wrench-02-0512-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>SHOP:</strong></span> <i>RANDY EMA, INC.</i>     <span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>LOCATION:</strong></span> <i>ORANGE, CALIF. </i><br /><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>OBSESSION:</strong></span> <i>DUESENBERGS</i>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<i>The Duesenberg Automobile & Motors Company produced some of the most luxurious cars of the early 20th century but couldn't survive the Great Depression. Randy Ema owns 28,000 of the company's original drawings, so he can produce brand-new parts for cars that are more than 75 years old.</i>\n\n<br /><br />\n\nStepping through Ema's door is like entering Santa's workshop&#151;if Santa had a serious thing for high-end antique cars. In one room, a drafting table holds a blueprint for some extinct part that's about to be reconstituted by Ema's craftsmen. In an adjacent room, a Bugatti motor sits on the floor next to a display case filled with old toy cars. Once you get past the museum-quality distractions out front&#151;hey, is that a set of Duesenberg headers just hanging on the wall?&#151;you're into the real action: the garage. Ema takes a photo of each car he's restored, and a far corner of the garage is wallpapered with snapshots of projects past. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDuesenbergs belong to a rarified league of automobiles. Founded in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1913 by brothers Friedrich and August Duesenberg, the company that bore their name created hand-built luxury performance cars on and off for 24 years. If you're lucky enough to own a Duesenberg (fewer than 1200 were made), Ema is the last word.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"I'm a historian,\" Ema says as we make our way toward the back of the shop. \"History is a passion for me and has been since I was a little kid. I like an original piece because it's only original once.\"  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nEma's never felt an urge to put his own riff on what the factories wrought, but one corner of his garage houses a personal project that allows some leeway for creative interpretation. \"This is my hot rod,\" Ema says. \"It's a '22 Duesenberg, but prior to 1934 someone cut the chassis and put a '28 Chrysler body on it.\" Today, fusing a Duesenberg and a Chrysler would constitute aesthetic and financial madness, but the chronological distance of that strange decision gives the car its own interesting story. And for Ema, that connects it spiritually to other Duesenbergs&#151;each car was a reflection of its owner. Each car has a story.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Nothing has come up to the standards of a Duesenberg,\" Ema says. \"No two cars are the same. You have this wonderful high-performance chassis and the body of your choice. Even today, they're fast.\" Supercharged Duesenberg Model Js could hit 129 mph, making them the Bugatti Veyrons of their era and a high-water mark for the American car industry. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere are 378 Model Js still in existence and Ema has laid eyes on all but three. There's one Model A he hasn't seen and it's in Australia. Ema maintains a stash of original drawings, patterns, and blueprints, which he uses to create more than 1000 different parts to keep the world's Duesenbergs on the road. For all practical purposes, Randy Ema is Duesenberg, circa 2012.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhile Ema's workshop could keep me entertained all day, I've got an appointment with another enthusiast almost 7 hours distant in San Francisco. The object of Jim Kanomata's expertise is certainly less exotic than a Duesy, but his affection for a very specific machine&#151;the 1973 to 1978 GMC recreational vehicle&#151;makes him a kindred spirit. So I bid farewell, fire up the RX-8, and merge onto I-5 north accompanied by the hard-edged, 9000-rpm song of America's last rotary.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/the-die-hard-mechanics-who-save-deloreans-and-duesenbergs-7588638-2\">The Motor Coachman >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Ll/brotherhood-of-the-wrench-03-0512-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-14T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Dyer","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"amoseman","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7588638","related_links":"<a href=\"/cars/news/vintage-speed/the-die-hard-mechanics-who-save-deloreans-and-duesenbergs-7588638\">The Die-Hard Mechanics Who Save DeLoreans and Duesenbergs</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/how-to-plans/woodworking/4294988\">The Boy Mechanic Makes Toys: A Boy's Motor Car</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/maintenance/4298501\">How to Read a Mechanic's Work Order</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/4289693\">Top 10 Automotive Tools Every Weekend Wrencher Should Own: Mechanic's Diary</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/1272206\">Mechanic Online--Use Your PC To Help Fix Your Car</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/2631071\">The Boy Mechanic</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/news/4258818\">Field Mechanic: This Is My Job</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/how-to-plans/woodworking/4294938\">The Boy Mechanic Makes Toys: A Guitar That Is Easy to Make</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/saturday-mechanic\">Saturday Mechanic</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/2236621\">This Is My Job -

As a wildlife inspector at the Port of Miami, he's already more than halfway through it: He has set eyes on everything from the world's most toxic snake, the taipan, to its biggest shark, the whale shark. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hires inspectors to stop the illegal wildlife trade&#151;at $10 billion to $20 billion per year, it's second only to arms and drug smuggling in the black market. \"We have to understand and enforce a range of U.S. and international laws, regulations, and treaties that limit the commercial traffic of endangered wildlife. We must be able to identify thousands of different species. And we verify that live animals are transported humanely,\" Gonz&#225;lez says. \"Every day is a new challenge.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/ey/wildlife-inspector-0512-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">1. LIVE ANIMALS</h3>\nDuring PM's visit, Gonz&#225;lez inspected shipments of green anacondas, Goliath bird-eater tarantulas, smooth-fronted caimans, and yellow-footed tortoises. \"With the exception of the tarantula, all the animals are protected by CITES&#151;the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,\" he says. \"Not all the animals are endangered, but CITES regulates their trade to prevent them from going extinct.\" The biggest challenge is identification: \"Species from the same genus can look alike except for one detail. One is protected, the other is not.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">2. FLASHLIGHT</h3>\nWildlife is shipped in bags or containers placed in crates. Gonz&#225;lez dons a pair of Kevlar-lined gloves, then shines a flashlight inside the box to check for loose animals&#151;like the monitor lizards he recently found at large. \"If we can handle the animal, then we'll try to catch it,\" he says. \"If not, we close the box, contact the importer, and let them do it.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">3. SNAKE HOOK</h3>\nIn 2011 more than 36.8 million animals were imported and exported through Miami, which receives more venomous animals than any other port in the U.S.&#151;at least 16,000 last year&#151;so snake hooks are essential. The inspectors relocate such shipments to a large room. \"We don't want to be in a confined space in case the animals get loose,\" Gonz&#225;lez says. \"We want to have an open area where we can handle them with the hooks if necessary.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">4. VIEWING TUBE</h3>\nAfter a bag has been placed on the floor, inspectors insert a plexiglass viewing tube to see what's inside. Sometimes bags are mislabeled (by accident or on purpose), such as the one Gonz&#225;lez peeked into that should have held frogs. The viewing tube showed its actual contents&#151;scorpions&#151;from a safe distance.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Open Format Article","publish_date":"2012-05-11T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11119","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"McCarthy","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7588644","related_links":"<a href=\"/outdoors/extreme-jobs/wildlife-inspector-this-is-my-job-7588644\">Wildlife Inspector: This Is My Job </a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/health/coral-snake-antivenom-crisis\">Coral Snake Antivenom Crisis Gets a One-Year Extension</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4285289\">Carnegie Mellon Modular Snake Robots for Cave Rescue ... and Mars?

Prevent Raccoon Eyes <br /></strong>Sure, waterproof mascara has staying power, but you can harm your lashes trying to remove it. To get just its benefits, apply a coat of your favorite mascara, then use a waterproof variety for a second coat. \"This locks in the mascara, but its removal is easier on lashes,\" says makeup artist Andrew Sotomayor.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Layer Your Blush <br /></strong>Keep your rosy glow by using two kinds of cheek color, says Cory Bishop, lead makeup artist for Temptu. Apply a cream formulation, like <strong>Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge</strong> ($24, department stores), on clean skin. Top with foundation, then dust on a powder blush in a similar shade. \"When that top layer wears off, you'll still have a flush,\" Bishop explains.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Brush On Base <br /></strong>For lasting foundation, it's best not to use your fingers, says Ashunta Sheriff, Mary Kay celebrity makeup artist: \"The oils in your skin will mix with the oils in the product, causing it to dissolve and slide.\" Stipple on with a makeup sponge or a flat foundation brush, like <strong>EcoTools Bamboo Foundation Brush</strong> ($6, drugstores), for all-day coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ensure Stay-On Shadow <br /></strong>\"Layering creams and pow- ders can help eye shadow stay put,\" says Sheriff. Apply a cream formula first, then top with a powder. \"The cream base creates a smooth, dry surface for the powder to adhere to,\" she explains. Use two versions of the same color, or choose a flesh-toned cream shadow to conceal any discoloration on lids.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>5. Lock In Concealer <br /></strong> Dusting on translucent powder is the best way to set makeup, but not around the eyes. \"It can really accentuate fine lines and wrinkles,\" explains Sheriff. Better: With a concealer brush, dot a mattifier, like <strong>Sonia Kashuk Perfecting Transparent Mattifier </strong>($15, Target), over your concealer. It'll absorb the oils that can cause concealer to melt and crease.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"971035","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/gi/how-far-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564035","related_links":"<a

Why? Lamar just split ties with the Dallas Mavericks and wants to focus on rejoining the NBA&#151;a move that Khloe has said she wants to take time to help him focus on.\n<br /><br />\n\nIt turns out that Khloe&#146;s approach to helping her hubs get through his basketball crisis is a total slam-dunk. Here&#146;s why&#133;and how you can (and should!) pull a Khloe when your man has a sucky day on the job. \n<br /><br />\n\n<b>His Job, His Manhood</b><br />\nKhloe&#146;s approach is so clutch because men get pretty insecure when they screw up at work. &#147;Guys define their manhood by their jobs, so when they have a career issue, they may start to feel like less of a man in other areas of their lives,&#148; explains relationship expert Tammy Nelson, PhD, author of Getting the Sex You Want. And that loss of confidence can have a big impact on your bond. &#147;When your man feels like a failure at work, he may start feeling depressed and pull away from you because he feels like he doesn&#146;t deserve you,&#148; says Nelson. He may even get paranoid that you&#146;ll leave him for a dude who in his mind has better boyfriend stats&#151;i.e. a guy who&#146;s getting promoted, not demoted, or has a higher-paying gig to begin with. <br /><br />\n\n<b>Back Off, Babe</b><br />\nSo, how should you handle it when your man is bumming on the job? Give him space. Tempting as it may be to expose the bitch who backstabbed him at work so your guy ends up on top, career and love gurus say that butting in and trying to solve your man&#146;s problems will backfire. &#147;Guys may think you don&#146;t believe in them if you try to deal with their work problems yourself, which makes them feel even more inadequate,&#148; explains career and behavioral expert Josh Shipp, host of career show Jump Shipp. <br /><br />\n\nThe right approach: Let him know that you&#146;re there for him, and trust that if he wants your help or just needs your ear, he&#146;ll bring up the topic with you when he feels ready. And when he does, don&#146;t bust out a color-coded 5-step plan of how to proceed&#151;just be supportive and compassionate. Relationship expert Matt Titus recommends giving him affectionate hugs and saying things like, &#147;You&#146;ve got this; I know you do,&#148; and &#147;I trust you to do what&#146;s right,&#148; so he understands that you&#146;re confident in his abilities to solve his problems&#151;not your own.  <br /><br />\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-02T16:14:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"7135","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Daly","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kmiller","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7186287","related_links":"<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/helping-your-guy-when-he-has-a-setback\">How To Help Your Guy After a Work Setback</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/ways-to-support-your-guy\">The #1 Good Girlfriend Habit to Break</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/introducing-your-boyfriend\">Guys Uncensored: What He Thinks When He Meets Your ...</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/be-a-good-girlfriend\">Good Girlfriend Behavior: Do This, Not That</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/How-to-Emerge-From-a-Fight-More-in-Love\">How to Emerge from a Fight More in Love</a><br>\n<a href=\"/advice/work-money/freaked-out-about-your-future\">Freaked Out About Your Future?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/dating-advice/what-to-say-to-new-guy\">The 9 Best Things to Say to a Guy You Just Met</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/bachelors/shirtless-men-sexy-guys\">Shirtless Bachelor Showdown</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/tips-moves/how-to-turn-him-on\">30 Things to Do with a Naked Man</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/train-boyfriend\">6 Ways to Train Your Boyfriend </a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T07:25:58.000Z","author_id":"11383","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"cosmopolitan","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-08T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Cosmopolitan","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/relationship-advice/helping-your-guy-when-he-has-a-setback","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Join this nationwide initiative","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":"uk-awyper","keywords":"Summer of Cycling 2012, cycling, cycling routes, cycling trails, bike rides, bike routes, bike trails, cycling for women, Summer of Cycling, cycling 2012, cycle routes","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Pedal into a summer of cycling","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-16T15:47:16.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Adrienne","source_id":"641","teaser":"Join this nationwide initiative","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Join this nationwide initiative","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"summer-of-cycling-2012-cycling-for-women","description":"Pedal into a summer of cycling: cycling for women in the UK's Summer of Cycling 2012 - another great outdoor exercise idea from allaboutyou.com - the online home of Coast, Country Living, House Beautiful, Prima and Good Housekeeping","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-03-16T15:47:12.000Z","title":"Pedal into a summer of cycling","custom_canonical":null,"allow_comment":"1","meta_title":"Pedal into a summer of cycling","contributor_email":null,"author":{"organization_id":"505","active":"Y","site_id":"601","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","last_name":"Wyper","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-03-08T12:07:35.000Z","id":"11280","last_updated_date":"2011-03-08T12:07:35.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Adrienne"},"import_section_id":null,"body":"<p>The Olympics are almost upon us and the British cycling team, including Sir Chris Hoy and Laura Trott are reckoned to be in a good position to take some medals.

He showed up an hour late with his two teenage daughters. After directing them to a table along the back wall, he apologized, explaining that he'd been at Mickey Rourke's discussing an upcoming film. Kaye &#151; a self-proclaimed genius who once compared his directing talent to Hitchcock's &#151; has a lot in common with Rourke. Both men crashed and burned in Hollywood, although Kaye had yet to make his comeback.</p>\n<p><em>American History X,</em> which Kaye directed about ten years earlier, both made his name and killed his career. Kaye was pushed from the movie for refusing to stop filming months after the studio and cast believed it was done. He brought a monk, a rabbi, and a priest with him to negotiate for more time, then demanded that his directing credit be changed to Humpty Dumpty. A couple years later, in November 2001, he showed up at a master class taught by his friend Marlon Brando dressed as Osama bin Laden. Brando cut him off. Soon after, the rest of Hollywood did, too, and Kaye spent the next five years or so shooting an abortion documentary and leaving hundreds of paintings from what he called his \"Left Lying Around Painting\" series in front of talent agencies, bus stops, and galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>But that night at the bar, Kaye sat down, ordered tea, and explained that he'd changed. Mellowed. He was no longer the difficult artist. He let his ego get in the way, but now things were different. He was working again. And then he jumped up.</p>\n<p>\"What time is it?\" he asked. It was late. He'd been working on becoming a singer/songwriter, he said. There was an open-mic night a few blocks away at the Bowery Poetry Club. Did I want to come and watch?</p>\n<p>Inside the club, Kaye signed up on the clipboard, and the four of us took seats. About an hour later, his name was finally called:</p>\n<p>\"Tony Kaye...\" the MC said. Then he paused, as though he were trying to figure out a puzzle. Because Tony Kaye had been missing for ten years. He was a legend, but a legend that had imploded, never to be heard from again. \"Is that <em>the</em> Tony Kaye from <em>American History X</em>?\"</p>\n<p>A few years later, I had a similar feeling as I watched Kaye's long-awaited follow-up to <em>History X, Detachment </em>(out now). The movie is about struggling teachers in a struggling inner-city school, and while it's illuminated by the same flat light and hopelessness of <em>History X,</em> it's not as inspired or satisfying. The dreariness of the lives on the screen is often too hard to watch &#151; everyone in the film wants to be dead, or soon will be. Still, I'm not ready to write Kaye off. And clearly neither are Adrien Brody, Christina Hendricks, and James Caan, who star in the film. That's the thing about claiming you're a crazy genius: Even if people want to call bullshit on you, they also want to stay close &#151; just in case there's any truth to it. It's why, three years ago in that dank poetry club, I sat through Kaye's whole set. And it's why I'll watch whatever he comes up with next.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-23T15:27:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"1060","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Cabot","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"pschrodt","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"The

Preparing for a triathlon needn&#146;t involve six months of sweating. &#147;If you have a good base of regular exercise, you can get there in eight weeks,&#148; says former British champion Rick Kiddle.</p>\n\n<p>Cheat one: we&#146;re doing a sprint triathlon, which is half as long as the Olympic distance. Cheat two: Mark Cavendish is your trainer, along with <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/sports-training/emmhem-interview-rebecca-adlington-511756\" title=\"Rebecca Adlington interview\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Adlington</a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/cardio-exercise/usain-bolts-speed-workout\" title=\"Usain Bolt's speed workout\" target=\"_blank\">Usain Bolt</a> (aka cheats three and four). With a coaching squad like that, failure would take effort.</p>\n\n<h2>Swimming coach</h2>\n<h4>See Olympic results with Rebecca Adlington</h4>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Boost stamina by 38%</strong> You could call this the deep end. For many triathletes, the swim needs the most work, and it all starts with breathing, says Adlington. &#147;People struggle with this when they&#146;re trying to concentrate on too many things,&#148; she says. Here&#146;s her fix: &#147;Stand up in the shallow end and put your face in the water. Practise turning your head, and getting a breathing rhythm.&#148; Exhale gradually in the water: research from the University at Buffalo in New York found that breathing exercises can increase respiratory endurance by 38%. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Train less, swim faster</strong> &#147;Vary your training,&#148; Adlington says. &#147;As with any sport you have to mix sprint sessions with endurance or recovery sessions. And don&#146;t just get in the pool and swim 2,000m. It&#146;s better to swim 100m intervals so you can control the intensity and speed.&#148; This tactic has been endorsed by researchers at Ball State University in the US. They found that swimmers who cut their training volume into segments improved their times. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Let rivals do the work</strong> On race day, try to stay within 5m of the person ahead (without getting kicked). A study in the <em>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</em> found you&#146;ll benefit from a 'pull' similar to the slip-stream F1 drivers catch.</p>\n\n\n\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-20T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bpalfreyman","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7333735","related_links":"<a href=\"/fitness/the-lazy-mans-triathlon-plan\">The lazy man's triathlon plan</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/davids-triathlon-blog-two-weeks-to-go-216151\">David&rsquo;s triathlon blog: 2 weeks to go</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/joes-triathlon-blog-two-weeks-to-go-216159\">Joe&rsquo;s triathlon blog: 2 weeks to go</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/davids-triathlon-blog-6-weeks-to-go-209900\">David's triathlon blog: 6 weeks to go</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/the-eight-week-triathlon-training-plan\">The eight-week triathlon training plan</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/joes-triathlon-blog-5-weeks-to-go-211124\">Joe's triathlon blog: 5 weeks to go</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/triathlon-race-tips\">Five triathlon tips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/triathlon-technology-337156\">Triathlon technology</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/davids-triathlon-blog-8-weeks-to-go-208620\">David's triathlon blog: 8 weeks to go</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/joes-triathlon-blog-8-weeks-to-go-208597\">Joe's triathlon blog: 8 weeks to go</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":"Apr '12 p91","print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:34:34.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-14T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/cardio-exercise/the-lazy-mans-triathlon-plan","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Between color-blocking, crochet, neon, and florals, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by abundance of cute choices.

Master the super-squat for faster muscle gains</h2>\n<h4>Hit your whole body to boost growth hormone</h4>\n<p>The barbell squat is every trainer&#146;s favourite because it hits your quads, hamstrings, glutes, lower back and abs. But <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/blogs/maximize-every-exercise/perfect-form-the-squat?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">technique is crucial</a>. &#147;If your core isn&#146;t strong you&#146;ll round your back during the move,&#148; says Mellis. This leads to lumbar problems, and reduces the work done by the muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency drive</strong> Flip the move and add a military press. &#147;By resting the bar on the front of your shoulders rather than the back, your torso stays more upright, which reduces potential back problems and works more of your abs,&#148; says Mellis. Adding the military press means you&#146;re working your shoulders and triceps too. Plus, you&#146;ll flood your body with testosterone and growth hormone, so you&#146;ll be building muscle 24/7.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> With an overhand grip, hold the bar across the front of your shoulders. Squat until your thighs are parallel to the floor then drive back up. Once you&#146;re standing, push the bar above your head.</p>\n<h2>2. Push away belly fat</h2>\n<h4>Build a strong, toned torso</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/get-big/4-ways-to-improve-your-bench-press?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">classic bench press</a> works all the muscles required for building a big chest. But that means it&#146;s tempting to overload the move, harming your form. &#147;A lot of men put too much weight on the bar,&#148; says Mellis. &#147;This shifts focus from your chest to your traps.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency drive</strong> Go back to basics. Drop your usual weight by 20%, keep your elbows near your sides and do your first set with your hands just fist-width apart. Then, to chisel your middle, do fat-burning leg-raises during your rest.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> Lie on a flat bench and lower the bar towards the middle of your chest. &#147;Push from the middle of your chest and straighten your arms,&#148; says Mellis. &#147;Good heel contact with the floor will keep your core engaged.&#148; Then, when the bar is safely back on the rack, lift your feet so your legs are parallel to the floor. Hold for the duration of your rest period and you can forget about doing that plank later.</p>\n<h2>3. A six-pack on the side</h2>\n<h4>Double your rowing power</h4>\n<p>Use the inverted row to hit core muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency drive</strong> &#147;This time-saving move will hit your abs without compromising the work on your back and arms,&#148; Mellis says.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> Set the bar of a squat rack to waist height. Hang from it with a Swiss Ball under your ankles. Brace your abs then pull up until your chest touches the bar.</p>\n<h2>4. A V-shape in one superset</h2>\n<h4>Upgrade your deadlifts</h4>\n<p>Engage more back muscles for big results.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency drive</strong> Before the main move, do side-lying leg-raises. &#147;This activates your glutes to help shift fat,&#148; says Mellis. Then target extra muscles in your back by combining a bent-over row and deadlift.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> Row the bar up to your chest; lower it, then stand upright. Do this with no rest in between &#150; time is muscle.</p>\n<h2>5. Cut your cardio with the perfect pull-up</h2>\n<h4>Use eccentric power to fast-track your strength</h4>\n<p>A true test of strength, <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/blogs/maximize-every-exercise/perfect-form-the-pull-up?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">the pull-up</a> works your lats, biceps, abs and shoulders. &#147;Most people cheat at this move,&#148; says Mellis. So stop swinging your legs, build even more muscle and arrive at the pub early.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency drive</strong> &#147;There&#146;s no shame performing half reps on the pull-up,&#148; says Mellis. A study in <em>Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise</em> found that 30 minutes of eccentric training (just the lowering section of a move) had comparable health benefits to three 60-minute weight sessions. Add knee-raises to perfect your six-pack and get your aerobic training done early.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> Use a box to bring yourself up to the bar. Grab it with an overhand, shoulder-width grip and very slowly lower yourself until you&#146;re hanging with straight arms. From this position, bring your knees up to your chest 10 times before letting go of the bar. This gives you a free cardio session; wave at the joggers on your way out.</p>\n<p><br /><em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Words: Wesley Doyle</span></em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br />Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Get constantly evolving workout and nutrition plans personalised for your specific needs and training goals. <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/personal-trainer-tool\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to <em>Men's Health</em>'s Personal Trainer tool now!</a></strong></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-18T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7480077","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-01-10T17:45:34.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-20T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/fast/the-worlds-most-efficient-workout","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Opposites attract, shop our black and white fashion picks.","site_id":"17","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.harpersbazaar.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"The BAZAAR: High Contrast","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-18T14:53:46.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Harper's Bazaar","source_id":"1","teaser":"Opposites attract, shop our black and white fashion picks.","origin_site_id":"17","sub_heading":"Opposites attract: Luxe up the graphic pairing with glints of gold.

add the fruit and veg (listed below) and blend on a high setting for 10-20 seconds. Then add two ice cubes (any more will make it too thick) and top with 200-300ml water, blitzing for a further 10 seconds.</p>\n\n<h2>The power punch</h2>\n<p>To boost the potency, you can add 2 tsp of blackstrap molasses. Yes, it looks like crude oil, but a recent study at Virginia Tech showed it had the highest antioxidant capacity of any sweetener &#150; helping to kill off wrinkle-causing free radicals.</p>\n\n<h2>The benefits</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Fight cancer</strong>\n<br /><font color=\"#e2ad00\">Kale, 1 handful</font><br />\nWith over 40 varieties of heart-protecting flavonoids, kale is the pound-for-pound nutrient champ of the plant world. Research in <em>Carcinogenesis</em> found that regular consumption inhibits the development of <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/symptoms-treatment/prostate-cancer-the-facts-241140\" title=\"Prostate cancer: the facts\" target=\"_blank\">prostate cancer</a>, the most common type in British men.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sharpen your mind</strong>\n<br /><font color=\"#e2ad00\">Purple-sprouting broccoli, 4 spears</font><br />\nA true nutritional powerhouse, <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/superfoods/a-beginners-guide-to-superfood-broccoli\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"More reasons to eat broccoli\">broccoli</a> is a rich source of selenium &#150; a mineral that is known to fight age-related cognitive decline. It also contains glucosinolates and calcium d-glucarate. Research in the journal <em>Toxicology</em> shows that these compounds help your liver process harmful toxins, allowing them to be flushed out of the body faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feed your muscles</strong>\n<br /><font color=\"#e2ad00\">Baby spinach, 1 handful</font><br />\nAdd lean, green power to your workouts to slow the rate at which you lose muscle mass over time. Studies at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that one serving of spinach a day delivered enough nitrates to vastly improve muscular efficiency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse aging</strong>\n<br /><font color=\"#e2ad00\">Blood orange, 1 peeled</font><br />\nThe red pigments that give this fruit its colour are called anthocyanins &#150; flavonoids which are known for their anti-ageing properties. Research in the journal <em>Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism</em> shows they also reduce oxidative stress and inflammation after exercise. Helpfully, the citrus tang will mask the taste of liquefied green vegetables, too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep your body lean</strong>\n<br /><font color=\"#e2ad00\">Raspberries, 14 or a large handful</font><br />\nThis low-carb well of antioxidants has been linked to a wide range of health benefits. But with summer on the way, perhaps the most timely are those of the waist-shrinking variety. Research in the journal <em>Life Sciences</em> found that raspberries&#146; ketones help reduce fat stores as we age.

Dance Theater</a></em></p>\n<p>In July 2008, I suffered what I thought was a career-ending injury &#151; a cartilage tear in my knee,\" says Alicia, who's danced with Alvin Ailey since 2005. \"I was devastated. But my mom reassured me that whether or not I came back as a dancer, anything I decided to do next would be brilliant.\" Alicia moved to St. Louis to get a master's degree in nonprofit management and teach dance on the side. She also married her long-term boyfriend. \"My mom saw the possibilities in me beyond the stage &#151; my health and happiness were paramount,\" she says. \"Her unconditional support motivated me to get back to doing what I love most: dancing. I knew the steps I had to take physically, but my mom was the one who helped me most emotionally. She would constantly reassure me and say, 'Do your best; God will take care of the rest.' \"</p>\n<p>In 2011, Alicia returned to the stage to rave reviews. \"It took immense courage for Alicia to make her comeback,\" Martha says. \"At that point, people were familiar with her career, so she had to return at the highest level. Yet she was able to keep her dance style fresh and evolving; that's difficult to do, as it involves retraining your body and your brain.\"</p>\n<p>Alicia's comeback stirred a change in Martha as well. \"Inspired by my daughter, I underwent a personal reinvention,\" says Martha, whose r&#233;sum&#233; already included jobs as a professor of social work, talk show host, model, and creator of a hotline for cancer survivors. \"I switched gears away from work and started to create my own art. I began painting interpretations of Alicia and other dancers from Alvin Ailey and Dance Theater of Harlem. Expressing myself through painting has given me a sense of peace that I've never felt before, and I'm grateful for my daughter, who's given me images that are beautiful enough to put on canvas. Dancing is Alicia's expression of beauty; painting is mine.\"</p>\n\n\n","slide_title":"MARTHA GRAF,

the best deals, look past eye level. </strong></p>\n<p>\"Eye level is the most desirable place on the shelf, where we put new products or the more profitable items,\" says Kim Coffin, senior director at Sunflower Farmers Market, a 35-store southwestern chain. But these items cost you more. Look at both top and bottom shelves, where items like tea, cereal, and macaroni and cheese can be 50% to 60% cheaper per serving.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&#160;<strong>Try before you buy. </strong></p>\n<p>Ask if you can sample an item first, suggests Danielle Halstead, store manager of New Seasons Market in Vancouver, WA. \"It's so easy for us to open a box or cut into one of those oranges before you buy a dozen.\" How to do it: Ask the manager or person in charge of the department for a sample, saying why. (\"I've never had these crackers before. Would it be possible to taste them to see if I like them?\")</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong>&#160;<strong>Ask for a better price. </strong></p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you something,\" says Meng Truong, owner of three Lee Lee International Supermarkets in Arizona. \"If you ask for a deal, I almost never say no.\" Whether you've found a lower price elsewhere or are buying in bulk, it's worth trying. Many chains like Whole Foods have a 10% unadvertised case or bulk discount&#151;you just have to ask for it at the register, says Rae Van Seenus, marketing supervisor for Whole Foods Market in Santa Barbara, CA.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Shop just after deliveries.&#160;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>\"At our stores, we have three fish shipments a week, on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday,\" says Truong. \"If you want it super-fresh, come at noon on those days.\" At your local store, ask for each department's regular delivery schedule and plan your weekly shopping accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong>&#160;<strong>Choose your store based on dry goods prices, not bread and milk. </strong></p>\n<p>Day-to-day items that sell in high volumes, like dairy and bread, are sold at close to cost, says Truong, which is why a sale on milk only saves you a few cents. But dry goods and items that fill the centers of stores for months on end? They often have much higher markups, and when they're on sale it can mean discounts as high as 50% to 60%. That's why the same box of cereal can be $5.99 at one store and $3.99 on sale at another. Simply skim the weekly ads for prices on your favorite cereals, coffee, canned goods and beverages.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong>&#160;<strong>Get to know the managers. </strong></p>\n<p>\"You want that personal relationship that you used to have with, say, the butcher,\" says Halstead. Introduce yourself, and let them know when you shop and what you're looking for&#151;whether that's the lowest prices or the best cuts of beef. They'll want to keep you as a customer, so they'll often tell you about sales that haven't been announced yet. They can also put aside sale items for you before they sell out. Best part: Managers can teach you how to maximize your coupons&#151;just ask.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong>&#160;<strong>Want organic? Look for the number 9. </strong></p>\n<p>Say goodbye to produce aisle confusion. \"Look for the little sticker on the item,\" says Halstead. \"All stickers have a four-digit code. If there's a 9 in front of it, it means it's organic.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-16T17:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"968695","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/1c/bag-of-groceries-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Cohen","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7625496","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-16T21:11:48.000Z","author_id":"11874","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-26T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/life/saving-money/grocery-shopping-tips","issue_date":"Woman's Day; April 2012","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Flexible extra rooms that won't break the bank","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":"","keywords":"house beautiful, outdoor rooms, extra rooms, extensions, home improvements, Homes advice, easy extensions","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Alternative home extensions","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-16T14:58:18.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"639","teaser":"Flexible extra rooms that won't break the bank","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"New ways to create flexible living space for your changing family needs.","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"alternative-home-extensions-extra-rooms","description":"Allaboutyou brings you a round-up of modular extensions.\nallaboutyou.com &#150; The online home of Good Housekeeping, Prima, Coast, Country Living and House Beautiful.

I talk to people about happiness,one question that often arises is, \"Sure, happiness has many elements. But if you had to pick the most important thing, what is the key to happiness?\" It's a question that can be answered in different ways, depending on what framework you use to ponder the issue, but if I had to choose, I think there are three keys to happiness.</p>\n<p><strong>The first key? Self-knowledge</strong></p>\n<p>\"Know yourself\" is advice that people have been doling out for thousands of years &#151; \"Know Thyself\" is inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the monument from ancient Greece that still stands today &#151; and it's also one of the most challenging.</p>\n<p>As part of my happiness project, I identified my 12 Personal Commandments &#151; the 12 principles that I want to guide my actions and thoughts &#151; and the first, most important commandment is, \"Be Gretchen.\"</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to know ourselves? You'd think that nothing could be simpler or more obvious. After all, you're hanging out with yourself all day long. But in fact, it's so easy to be distracted by the way we wish we were, or the way other people expect us to be, that we lose sight of what's true about ourselves.</p>\n<p>For instance, I've finally admitted to myself that although I can choose what I do, I can't choose what I <em>like</em> to do. I wish I had a passion for music, but I just don't. Along the same lines, I've admitted that just because something is fun for other people doesn't mean it's fun for me, and vice versa. Rollerblading, drinking wine, shopping, cooking, doing crossword puzzles...so many people find these activities fun, but I don't. Everyone in my family lying around reading in their pajamas? Ah, that sounds like fun.</p>\n<p>The fact is, we can build a happy life only on the foundation of our own natures, interests, and values. I've found that the more faithfully I'm able to \"be Gretchen\" in my daily life, the happier I become.</p>\n<p><strong>The second key to happiness: anticipation</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>If the future holds no pleasant promise &#151; well, it's very hard to be happy. Anticipation is the first stage, and a critical one, of enjoying a happy event. The other three stages are:</p>\n<p><strong>Savoring: </strong>Enjoying something in the moment (remember to turn off your cell phone!).</p>\n<p><strong>Expression: </strong>Giving voice to your pleasure to heighten your experience (think of crowds cheering at a baseball game, for example).</p>\n<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Looking back on happy times (for example, by pulling out the photo album).</p>\n<p>No matter what your circumstances, if you have something to look forward to, you bring happiness into your life well before the event actually takes place; you grab more happiness from a happy event, because it makes you happy even before you experience it. In fact, sometimes the happiness of anticipation is greater than the happiness of the actual experience &#151; that's known as \"rosy prospection.\"</p>\n<p>We should all be able to flip through our calendars and see at least a few pleasant things scheduled for future weeks. If your life is a parade of obligations, dreaded tasks, unpleasant encounters, and mandatory appearances, take a minute to figure out something that you'd find fun, and make time for it. Wish you had time to walk in the park with your dog? To work on a craft project? To have coffee with your sister? Schedule it on your calendar like you would a dentist appointment. Even before it happens, you'll get a happiness boost every time you anticipate it. (Also, if you put it on your calendar, you'll be far more likely to actually do it.)</p>\n<p>However, as you're considering ways to amplify your sense of happy anticipation, don't forget happiness key number one. Just because something is fun for other people doesn't mean it's fun for you. Be honest about your likes and dislikes. Don't pretend that you like visiting museums or going on bike rides if you don't. Your fun may not look like other people's fun. I myself love to help other people clean out their closets. Skiing, no way &#151; but cleaning out a friend's closets? That I anticipate with relish.</p>\n<p><strong> Next: <a href=\"/health/wellness/keys-to-happiness-2\">The third key to lasting happiness</a> </strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-16T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Rubin","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-gretchen-rubin","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564016","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/keys-to-happiness\">Built-In Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/wellness/tips-for-increasing-happiness\">The How of Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/happy-at-any-age\">Three Celebs Reveal the Secret to Happiness &mdash; at Any Age!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/jennifer-aniston-happiness-plan\">Jennifer Aniston's Happiness Plan</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/how-to-be-happy-in-marriage\">The Happiness Project: How to Be Happy in Marriage</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/books-happiness-guides-0407\">Guides for Achieving Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/find-happiness-holiday-season\">Unwrapping Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/health-benefits-of-volunteering\">Voluntarily Happy </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/serve-others\">The Happiness Boomerang</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/how-to-be-happy\">Can Money Really Buy Happiness ?</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:38:15.000Z","author_id":"11109","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/keys-to-happiness","issue_date":"May 2012","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Singer-songwriter Eric Hutchinson is (finally!) releasing some new tunes.

Keep reading to eavesdrop on our convo!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Seventeen:</strong></em> I love the video for your new single, \"Watching You Watch Him\".</p>\n<p><strong>Eric Hutchinson:</strong> Thank you! We filmed it in Burbank, California. We had a day off from touring, so we just went out and did the video.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> I think the sentiment in the song, liking someone but that person liking someone else, is something everyone can relate to.</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Yeah, it's kind of a messed up love triangle. When I play the song at shows, after the concert, people will come up to me and say that I was singing about their life. We'll hug it out. It's good to create something and have it connect with people.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> What are some other songs on your new album that you think people will really relate to?</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> There's a song called \"I'm Not Cool\", which I wrote as sort of a joke to myself. It's about trying to keep up with being cool, wearing the right styles and driving the right car, and feeling like I can't live up to that. I don't have much interest in trying to be cool at all. There's another song called \"Best Days\" about holding onto something when it's good and celebrating that moment. It's about taking the time to step back and realize how lucky you are.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> Have you ever written a song about someone and that person has gotten mad at you?</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Sometimes. I try not to do it, but there's a song on the album called \"Lisa\" which is about a person I know. I sort of made fun of her a little too much because I took an idea and exaggerated it a bit. It's about that friend in life who is not willing to compromise on anything. When you want to hang out, you have to go to their house, you have to eat the food they like, and you have to watch the movies they like. It's sort of a joke about that. But my friend actually liked the song!</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> Did you call her and say, \"Hey, want to come over and hear my new song?\" and did she say, \"No, bring it over to my house!\"?</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Exactly!&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> Along with your album coming out, you're also going on tour, starting April 17.</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Yeah, even if you don't know all the songs, coming to a show is a really good way to check it out. It's an upbeat show. It's all about having a good time.</p>\n<p><strong>17:</strong> Do you have a favorite type of crowd? Like, do you love college shows the most or a certain city?</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> I like any crowd that's energetic. The show is 50/50 between the audience and me. That energy is really a circle. I'll start it off by coming out there, but I hope the audience picks it up and gives it back. I really feed off that stuff. It's really fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Eric Hutchinson's new album <em>Moving Up Living Down</em> will be available in stores and on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/eric-hutchinson/id31211068\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> April 17, 2012.

So the chance to try the latest Aromatherapy Associates facial and spend an hour being slathered in lovely products was my idea of bliss.</p>\n<p><strong>Spa locations</strong><br /> The new Aroma Lift facials are available in two London locations - Aromatherapy Associates Boutique &amp; Treatment Rooms, 5 Montpelier Street, SW7 1EX and The Spa at Mandarin Oriental, 66 Knightsbridge - and nationwide in the Hotel Missoni Edinburgh, Aura hotel Ascot, In Harmony hotel Hampton Court and the Esse hotel Hertfordshire. I rolled up to London&#8217;s plush Mandarin Oriental hotel for mine. Men in red coats rushed to open the door as I swept up the grand marble steps to the huge front doors of the beautiful stone brick building in swish Knightsbridge (&#8217;sweeping up&#8216; is obligatory when it comes to grand steps). And if you&#8217;re going to fork out over one hundred pounds for a facial you might as well have doors opened for you. Inside was all opulence and luxury, more marble staircases to sweep up and people keen to escort me wherever I wanted to go.</p>\n<p><br />I went downstairs to the spa - yes, you guessed it, another marble staircase - and entered a softly lit room, calm and quiet with somewhere in the distance the sound of cascading water. This was less &#8216;trickle of a water feature&#8216;, more &#8216;waterfall flow&#8216;. Display shelves were filled with beautiful Aromatherapy Associates bottles and stately canisters of tea from the Tea Palace - of which I&#8217;m also a fan.</p>\n<p><strong>5-star luxury</strong><br /> There was a lovely welcoming vibe in the spa, you do get very well treated in a 5-star hotel. Herbal tea arrived as I filled up my consultation form, and my slippers were served on a tray! The spa advises clients to arrive at least 45 minutes before treatments to enjoy the lovely &#8216;ladies only&#8217; facilities here. In a stylish contemporary zone, there&#8217;s a beautifully designed plunge pool with a raised-area steam room and sauna. I had a quick steam to open my pores, then hightailed it to the relaxation room to meet my therapist.</p>\n<p><br /><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/I6/machine-300.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />First she talked me through the facial I&#8217;m about to have. As well as all the lovely AA products, this facial has a high tech element. A new machine, just launched by the brand, will send electrical impulses through my skin to lift and firm and smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Think of it as a gym workout for&#160; your face, she said - I liked the idea of a gym workout that happens while I&#8217;m lying down.</p>\n<p>The products used in the facial are mainly rose based -&#160;Renewing Rose Cleanser, Triple Rose Moisturiser, and Nourishing Face Oil - I also had an enzyme peel to remove dead skin cells and a Vitamin C boost treatment. The electrical impulses were applied to my skin through two metal probes which were moved over the entire surface of my face. Special attention was paid to the deeper lines around my mouth and the skin over my eyes, which while not quite &#8216;hooded&#8217; is certainly &#8216;floppier&#8217; than it used to be. There was a faint pulsing sensation from the probes as they moved around my face, I could see vibrating light when they were used near my eyes and had a metallic taste in my mouth when they were working in this area but none of it was unpleasant.</p>\n<p>And I was dying to see the effect on my lines once the facial was finished. My skin certainly felt baby soft and plumped - &#8216;your skin looks amazing&#8217; my therapist told me, but I figured she would say that. So I peered closely at my face in the mirror. Had the deep lines around my mouth faded a little? Just a little? Maybe. My forehead looked quite smooth and all-in-all there was a glow about my skin where there wasn&#8217;t one before. So I happily took myself off to the opulent surrounds of the Mandarin Oriental lounge for a post-facial decaf Cappuccino before going back to everyday life.</p>\n<p>&#160;<strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br /> Aromatherapy Associates Ultimate Aroma Radiance Lift facial (90 minutes) from &#163;95 (Aromatherapy Associates Boutique &amp;

Here she shares how she finally got fit and took back her life.</p>\n<p>My secret binge eating started when I was 13, after my grandpa died. I really looked up to him and we were very close, so when he passed away, I turned to food to comfort myself. In high school, I was very active and ran cross-country, but I still gained weight because I was overeating when no one was around. At 19, I shed about 30 pounds in the months before my wedding by going on a crash diet. But after I had my daughter and son, the weight gradually crept back on and before I knew it, I was over 200 pounds. I felt so unattractive that I hardly have any family photos from that time. Occasionally I'd lose 30 pounds but then I'd gain back 35 more. It was a vicious cycle.</p>\n<h3><strong>&#8594; Focusing on me </strong></h3>\n<p>In 2008, my daughter, a senior in high school, told me that she didn't want to be a cheerleader anymore. I was upset&#151;not because I was disappointed in her, but because it would leave a hole in my own life. I had been devoting all of my free time to my children's activities; at one point, my daughter even told me to stop living through her. Her comment hurt, but she was right: I didn't have a life of my own. I was too embarrassed about my body to go out and socialize. I knew then that I had to do something about my weight and \"get a life,\" since both my children were nearing college age and would be leaving home.</p>\n<h3><strong>&#8594; The big jumpstart </strong></h3>\n<p>That year, two days before Christmas, I sat down and searched for weight-loss plans online. I found <a href=\"http://www.sparkpeople.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SparkPeople.com</a> (an online health and weight-loss community) and began to log what I ate; I also read other people's blogs to stay motivated. I joined a gym in January of 2009, and it just so happened that it was hosting a Biggest Loser&#151;type competition. I signed up, worked out with a trainer a few times a week, and at the end of 12 weeks, I had lost 50 pounds and won the individual female weight-loss category!</p>\n<p>Afterward, I continued to eat healthfully and stuck to 1,200-1,500 calories per day. The competition kickstarted my weight loss, but I knew I needed to find an activity that I really loved and would do long-term. Dancing seemed like a fun challenge, so I used a coupon I had for a free private dance lesson. The first class was a mix of cha-cha and salsa dancing, and I definitely felt clumsy and awkward, but I had so much fun that I decided to keep going.</p>\n<h3><strong>&#8594; Dancing my way thin </strong></h3>\n<p>Over the course of a year, I continued to lose weight (about 50 more pounds) and improve my dancing. In 2011, I competed in rumba, cha-cha, bolero, mambo and East Coast swing at two different dance competitions. Dancing has taught me how to carry myself, control my body and just have fun. Now, at 41, I'm not afraid to take chances and I finally feel attractive, something I've never experienced. And yes: I now have a life.</p>\n<h3><em>My best tip</em></h3>\n<p><em>Pick a \"cravings\" day.</em> If I have a craving during the week, I tell myself to hold off until Saturday. If I still want it then, I eat it&#151;but I often find that the urge has passed.</p>\n<h3><strong>My stick-with-it secret</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>USE VISUAL REMINDERS</strong> I carried around this \"before\" picture of myself when I was at my heaviest as daily inspiration to stay on track. I would pull it out whenever I felt my commitment waning. It was a great reminder that I didn't want to go back to that overweight place <em>and</em> a positive reinforcement of how far I'd come. It really came in handy the night before my first dance showcase (after I'd lost 65 pounds). I was terrified that I would freeze up, but then I looked at the picture and thought, <em>Wow, I've come too far to turn back now.</em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-12T19:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"976886","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/xO/i-lost-103-pounds-before-after-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Cuffey","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mbodgas","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7710892","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-12T20:30:33.000Z","author_id":"13163","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/health-fitness/diet-weight-loss/i-lost-103-pounds","issue_date":"Woman's Day; May 2012","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Modern love can be summed up in one quick status update: It's complicated.

I knew what she meant: My caramel-colored skin and curly hair, the product of a '70s-era marriage between a white Midwestern woman and a black Southern man, marked me as the living embodiment of the triumph of love at the time.</p>\n<p>I was raised to be open-minded and curious. And my biracial heritage gave me a vantage point to see the world from different perspectives. But in my late teens and early 20s, this didn't prevent me from assuming my own racial blind spots, especially when it came to love. Turns out that the girl who \"looked like the world\" had a very muddled view of it. I didn't know who I was, or whom to trust.</p>\n<p>When darker-skinned men wanted to date me, I assumed it was because they considered me a trophy for my light skin. It reminded me of seeing so many successful and powerful black males &#151; politicians, businessmen, entertainers &#151; who appeared alongside lighter-skinned, sometimes white female companions. Tokenism? It wasn't for me, so I either outright rejected black men or begrudgingly went on dates with them only to write them off well before the dessert course arrived.</p>\n<p>Caucasian men were another problem: I didn't believe they saw me as a potential romantic partner, given that I knew so few white male/black female couples. And although I socialized and worked with white men, the romantic relationships I entered into with them were brief and unremarkable. I didn't trust them either, assuming they saw me as a novelty, as a way to sample another culture, or as a stand-in for all black women.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, my distrust of men didn't get me far. I hadn't yet learned that giving others the benefit of the doubt was an important part of finding love, both from others and within myself. I was ignorant that appearances could be both deceiving and alienating &#151; that my racialization of romance kept me at arm's length from deeper intimacy. Not trusting that white or black men would see beyond my skin color let me stay apart, aloof, even a little superior. It gave me an excuse to overlook the fact that I had trust issues with all men, that my hesitations and presumptions were less about fears of being rejected and more about my anxieties over really being seen.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got over myself. In my mid-30s, I met and married a dark-haired white Australian. He was well-acquainted with interracial relationships &#151; two of his sisters had babies with men of color &#151; and was generally less concerned with appearances than I was. \"Look, I'm darker than you!\" he once pointed out after I'd tried &#151; and failed &#151; to get a tan while on vacation. It was a joke, but it was also true.

It&#146;s far better to cut the pain short. &#147;Work meetings are a good model,&#148; he says. You want to be in and out, so mentally set the agenda before you see her: what you plan to say, how you want to leave things. &#147;Decide what contributed to 80% of your decision to break up &#150; work commitments, compatibility, whatever &#150; and only address that. It&#146;s less for you, and her, to deal with.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Expert exit strategy</strong> Set an &#145;implementation deadline&#146;. Arrange a place you have to be after you&#146;ve broken it to her. This way, you will just say what has to be said, instead of spending hours going over things.</p>\n\n<h2>Anaesthetise her anger</h2>\n<p>If you suspect your girl&#146;s a screamer (the bad kind), anger management specialist David Woolfson says location and timing are key. &#147;In the morning, we&#146;re less stressed and tired so it&#146;s harder to feel aggressive,&#148; he says.</p>\n<p>&#147;A cafe&#769; that neither of you have visited before is ideal. Homes are full of inflammatory memories, and a public place means there are social boundaries that help keep things quiet.&#148; If she still blows, acknowledge her anger. Tell her that you know why she&#146;s angry &#150; even that you&#146;re angry with yourself for not making the relationship work. &#147;Never tell her to calm down. Infuriated people need someone to take control, but not to take their power away.&#148; And, as with any cornered animal, don&#146;t touch her. &#147;This conveys intimacy. It delivers mixed messages and can stoke further rage.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Expert exit strategy</strong> Ask a question. &#147;Rage activates our uncivilised brain, so to calm someone, force them to use their rational brain by asking questions.&#148; Try something specific about the relationship such as, &#145;Why do you think we could never agree on holiday destinations?&#146;</p>\n\n<h2>Soften the blow</h2>\n<p>You may not be delivering news about a catastrophic earthquake, but careful language and a newsreader&#146;s tone can make the break-up quick and painless. &#147;Give the headline first, then the facts,&#148; says broadcaster Samira Ahmed. Tell her that you&#146;re breaking up, with a pause before and after you say it, so she can absorb the information. Then follow up with the why, and keep things simple: &#145;We argue all the time. I&#146;m unhappy&#146;. Be succinct. &#147;Limit yourself to one idea per sentence, not &#145;We&#146;re breaking up and I&#146;m moving out on Friday,&#146;&#148; Ahmed suggests. &#147;Avoid sentimentality or drama because you assume that&#146;s what&#146;s required. Remember, it&#146;s about getting the information across.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Expert exit strategy</strong> Take a breath. &#147;Exhale before you speak. Then, when you open your mouth to talk, take in just enough air to deliver your line.&#148; This newsreader&#146;s trick will keep your voice clear and your tone level.</p>\n\n<h2>Reduce the tears</h2>\n<p>Unless you&#146;re the romantic equivalent of a Coldplay album, she&#146;s not going to be happy that it&#146;s over. Prepare for questions, says Dr Bethany Dick, who knows how people react to bad news. &#147;A swift, smooth response is gentler than dragging things out.&#148; Try not to overwhelm her with information. &#147;Grieving people stop taking things in,&#148; she says. &#147;Fire a &#145;warning shot&#146; to see how much they can cope with. If you live together, just say: &#145;I&#146;ll be moving out.&#146; If she breaks down, add &#145;But we&#146;ll discuss that on Tuesday.&#146;&#148; Giving her a specific time provides a step forwards and brings the conversation to a natural end.</p>\n<p><strong>Expert exit strategy</strong> Phone a friend. &#147;Don&#146;t leave her alone. Call on a mutual friend who you trust to be unbiased and supportive.&#148; They will be the buffer you both need.</p>\n\n<h2>Survive the online fallout</h2>\n<p>Things can get nasty if your ex decides to vent on Facebook or Twitter. &#147;What&#146;s said online is hugely influential and a reputation can take years to recover,&#148; says social media manager Katie Khan. <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/mens-health-dating/how-to-survive-a-break-up\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How to survive a break-up\">How you deal with it</a> marks the difference between dignified and undateable. &#147;First, get a feeling for the online mood.&#148; Maintain a noble silence if she&#146;s just making snide comments, but step in if she starts revealing information that could compromise other relationships. &#147;When companies issue a response to a smear, they keep it businesslike and request that the matter is taken out of the public domain.&#148; Whether it&#146;s your ex or friends rallying on her behalf, send a polite two-line response suggesting they email you privately.</p>\n<p><strong>Expert exit strategy</strong> Have a cooling-off period. \"Hide rather than change your Facebook relationship status, and wait three months before de-friending her or un-tagging photos\".</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><font size=\"1\">Words: Debbie Willimott</font></em></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-12T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7211023","related_links":"<a href=\"/sex/more/7-steps-to-a-row-free-relationship-199967\">7 steps to a row-free relationship </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/reboot-your-relationship-425630\">Reboot your relationship </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/reset-your-relationship\">Reset your relationship </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/relationship-myths-busted\">Relationship myths busted</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/how-to-end-a-relationship-349316\">How to end a relationship </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/ive-noticed-some-blisters-on-the-inside-of-my-foreskin-but-my-local-gum-clinic-is-unsure-of-the-cause-ive-been-in-a-faithful-relationship-for-years-so-am-worried-it-could-be-something-more-serious-hav\">I've noticed some blisters on the inside of my foreskin, but my local GUM clinic is unsure of the cause.

It&#146;s a risky business because poor oral care, and the resulting bacterial growth, is linked to heart disease, diabetes and erectile dysfunction (not to mention far fewer dates). <em>MH</em> has scoured the latest research and asked top dentists for their advice on how to keep your choppers chopping.</p>\n\n<p><strong><font color=\"#2180ba\">Work the right way...</font></strong></p>\n<p>Dentists recommend the \"modified Bass technique\" &#150; a thorough method named after the forefather of modern dentistry, Dr Charles Bass. Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line, and gently vibrate so the bristles barely move. Work your way around. Don't miss the lingual surface &#150; the inner side of the tooth. This area is a breeding ground for plaque, a recent study in the <em>American Journal of Dentistry found</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><font color=\"#2180ba\">...and in the right direction</font></strong></p>\n<p>Brushing toward your gums will eventually push the tissue back, making your gum line recede, warns dentist Dr Bruce DeGinder. \"On the upper teeth, you want to be brushing downwards, and on the lower teeth, brush upwards,\" he says.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><font color=\"#2180ba\">Know your blind spots</font></strong></p>\n<p>\"Right handers have more difficulty cleaning the right side, and left handers will have problems on the left,\" says Dr Matthew Messina, spokesperson for the American Dental Association. The awkward wrist turn makes it harder to reach some spots, so spend extra time on your weak side. Bonus: using your non-dominant hand to brush your teeth encourages the production of neurotrophins in your brain, slowing the process of mental ageing.</p>\n\n<p><strong><font color=\"#2180ba\">Less is more for gum care</font></strong></p>\n<p>\"Many people use tremendous force when brushing their teeth, and I'll see them with gum tissue that's worn away and exposing the root surface,\" says Dr DeGinder. The fix: stop gripping your brush like a tennis racket. Instead, he suggests you try holding the brush like you would a pen, forcing a lighter stroke.</p>\n\n<p><strong><font color=\"#2180ba\">Nuke germs on your brush</font></strong></p>\n<p>Your toothbrush harbours more undesirables than a <em>Made in Chelsea</em> wrap party. Fortunately, you can eliminate these germs by microwaving them, Brazilian dentistry researchers found. They submerged brushes in a cup of clean water and then microwaved them for 60 seconds, after which the brushes emerged bug free. Do this every week or two, Dr DeGinder suggests. If you use an electric toothbrush, it's best to detach the base first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Top tips</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Go electric</em>: For less plaque and gingivitis, trade in your manual brush, says a recent UK study. Use one with a timer so you hit the optimum two minutes.</p>\n\n<p><em>Interplay</em>: A little tool called an interdental brush is more effective than floss for removing plaque between your teeth, says a new study in <em>Evidence-Based Dentistry</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>See Sense</em>: A bioactive glass called NovaMin found in some toothpastes can repair the tubules in teeth that cause sensitivity, says the <em>Journal of Clinical Dentistry</em>.</p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\"><em>Words: Alex Harris.

You can always go darker step by step, but if you go overboard, you'll need a pro's help to lighten a botched job. If you're considering darkening your hair a few shades but aren't quite sure the look will suit you, try a trick from New York City stylist Eva Scrivo, who says, \"Hair becomes two to three shades darker when wet. Wet your hair, put on your daytime makeup, and comb the hair next to your face. You will instantly know if your complexion looks brighter, healthier, or clearer surrounded by the darker hue.\"</p>\n<p><strong>WATCH OUT FOR... </strong>Getting stuck in a rut. \"Brown is one of the easiest haircolors to do at home,\" says Kiyah Wright, a hair colorist at Warren Tricomi salon in Los Angeles. But that doesn't mean you should reach for the same old box you've been using for years. Especially as your hair grays, your old standby isn't likely to produce the same results. If you're a natural brunette, stay within one or two shades of your own color. That will ensure that the outcome will still be flattering to your skin. Going too light might make your skin look sallow. Even if your usual color still looks good, consider giving hair a boost: John Frieda Precision Foam Colour Salon Blends Collection ($13, drugstores) is the first at-home color formula with three tones in one bottle, not the usual one or two &#151; closer to a custom salon blend, which produces more vibrant color. Another way to keep brown dynamic, not drab: Use a light styler, like Pantene Aqua Light Weightless Conditioning Shake ($6, drugstores). Its conditioners will give hair an even sheen, so the color looks shiny.</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE IT LAST </strong>The challenge with brown hair is usually not darker regrowth (as with blond or light red), but visible gray roots, which can show up every two weeks. Even if you get your color at a salon, fixing roots at home is a convenient time saver. Try Revlon Root Erase by ColorSilk ($4.50, drugstores). This mini hair dye is designed to go on your roots only, though in the last few minutes you can run it through the rest of your hair to boost its vibrancy. For especially resistant grays, try Clairol Professional Gray Busters ($6, Sally Beauty Supply), a pro line that can be used at home. Whatever you choose, don't apply it all over your hair, warns celebrity hairstylist Sarah Potempa. If you continually re-dye your ends, they'll turn out drab. If you don't have time to color, there are also several quick, short-term fixes for gray roots: A spray, a hair mascara, or even dark brown powder eye shadow will provide easy coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>LEAVE IT TO THE PROS </strong>Get help when you want to switch color families. When it comes to brown shades, \"there are ashes, red-browns, and neutrals,\" says Wright, and for at-home tweaks, it's best to stay in the same color family as your existing hue. Otherwise, you'll end up too red or too dark, and you'll need a pro to correct the color.</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"http://goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/home-hair-coloring-tips-black\" target=\"_self\">How to get a perfect shade of black</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-11T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"973057","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/8E/0512-brown-hair-color-products-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Gage","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564012","related_links":"<a href=\"/product-reviews/anti-aging-hair-products\">Anti-Aging Hair Products</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/right-hair-color\">Find the Right Hair Color for You</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/younger-looking-hair\">Take 10 Years Off Your Hair </a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/best-home-hair-color\">Best At-Home Haircolor</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair-coloring-tips\">Expert Answers to Your Biggest Hair Color Questions</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/hair-color-q&amp;a-0203\">Tips for Getting Salon-Perfect Hair Color At Home </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/best-hair-products-advice\">Our Best-Ever Hair Advice</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair-care-myths-0800\">10 Common Hair -Care Myths</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/haircut-hairstyle-ideas-women\">No More Bad Hair Days</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/home-hair-coloring-tips\">Color Your Hair Like a Pro</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:38:14.000Z","author_id":"37876","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/home-hair-coloring-tips","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Look like a million &#151;

Pin the two mouse pieces together, sandwiching 1.5cm of ribbon or leather string between the layers as a tail.</p>\n<p>2 Machine stitch a 3mm seam around the edge, using matching thread and leaving a 2cm opening at the centre of the bottom edge. Stuff the mouse with wadding and stitch the opening closed.</p>\n<p>3 Place a printed inner ear on top of one felt ear and hand-sew just the bottom edges securely to one side of the top of the head (so the ears can move). Repeat to attach the other ear and inner ear to the other side of the head.</p>\n<p>4 With an embroidery needle and pink thread, embroider a small nose in satin stitch. In black thread (for white or grey felt) or pink thread (for black felt), sew four long stitches in a fan shape on each side of the nose as whiskers; the knot will show, so it can be part of the effect. Sew on two black sequins for the eyes using matching thread (A).</p>\n<p>5 Using a small flat brush, paint a large matchbox case inside and out with white emulsion and then leave to dry (B).</p>\n<p>6 Measure the box and cut out a rectangle of printed cotton fabric that is as wide as the length of the matchbox case, and as long as the circumference plus 1.5cm for an overlap. Stick double-sided tape around both ends of the case and two strips side by side along the middle of the underside.</p>\n<p>7 Remove the backing from the tape and start sticking the fabric to the case at the middle of the underside, covering one of the strips of tape running down the centre. Wrap the fabric around the case, with the edges aligned (C). When you get back to the beginning, stick the end of the fabric to the other strip of tape, trimming off any excess.</p>\n<p>8 On a second, complementary printed cotton fabric, draw around the inner box using tailor&#146;s chalk. Cut out the rectangle and stick it to the base of the inner box on the inside using double-sided tape. Slide the inner box into the outer case and put the mouse inside.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/9l/PR-mouse-template300x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/xg/PR-mouse-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/r5/PR-Homemade-Home-for-CHildren-book-150x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" /></h3>\n<p><strong>This project is taken from 'The Homemade Home for Children' by Sania Pell (Cico Books, &#163;16.99). <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781908170194\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy the book from the Allaboutyou online bookshop, with free P&P</a></strong></p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/countryliving/countryliving-events/Country-Living-craft-projects-for-children\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see all of the craft projects for children in Country Living's May 2012 issue</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/making/craft-ideas-children-decorate-children-rooms\" target=\"_blank\">More easy craft ideas for children's rooms</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/make-a-mouse-pincushion-42190\" target=\"_blank\">Sew a mouse pincushion</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-10T12:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"7","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"31.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7698288","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2011-12-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-11-29T18:31:22.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/Make-matchbox-mice","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Add a tin bath to make a boat","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"Sania Pell, Country Living, Make a play sail","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Make a play sail","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-29T15:16:39.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"636","teaser":"Add a tin bath to make a boat","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Place an old tin bath underneath this smart sail, designed by Sania Pell, to create a boat","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"Make-play-sail","description":"Make a play sail  designed by Sania Pell, another craft project for children, from Country Living, on allaboutyou.com &#150; The online home of Good Housekeeping, Prima, Coast and House Beautiful.

Lay it on a work surface and check that the cut edge is straight.</p>\n<p>2 Fold the fabric in half lengthwise. With a pencil or tailor&#146;s chalk, draw a diagonal line from the top right-hand corner of the fabric to the bottom left-hand corner. Cut along this line through both layers (A) and then open out the triangle.</p>\n<p>3 Turn under a 1.5cm hem on all three edges, press, pin in place and stitch. Pin two lengths of striped ribbon to the sail, parallel to the bottom edge, dividing the triangle into three sections (B). Stitch the ribbons in place.</p>\n<p>4 For the pocket, cut out a 38cm x 30cm rectangle from canvas. Turn under and press a 1.5cm hem on the side edges and fray the top and bottom edge using a pin to tease out threads parallel to the edge. Take a kit of ten jumbo metal grommets (12mm) and, following the manufacturer&#146;s instructions, apply three grommets along the top edge of the pocket, and one grommet to each corner of the sail. Pin the pocket at the centre of the bottom portion of the sail, and topstitch in place along the side and bottom edges, leaving the top edge open.</p>\n<p>5 Following the manufacturer&#146;s instructions, iron fusible bonding web to the wrong side of a piece of denim. Using the star template <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/Make-play-sail-templates\" target=\"_blank\">(see page 2) </a>, draw a star on the backing paper. Also draw the mirror image of each initial or number you would like to include. Cut out the shapes, remove the backing paper, and iron them in place on the sail. Tie a length of wide rope (5mm) or strong ribbon or string to the grommets at the two bottom corners of the sail, and tie the other ends to pieces of furniture. Hang the top grommet from a secure screw in the wall, or use a third length of rope to tie it to a tree.</p>\n<p>6 For the flag, cut out a 50cm x 35cm rectangle from the canvas left over from cutting out the triangle for the sail. Turn 1.5cm to the wrong side along the long bottom edge, and then press, pin, and stitch. Now turn 5mm and then a further 1.5cm to the right side along one short side edge; press, pin, and machine stitch. Finally, turn 1.5cm to the wrong side along the other short side edge and the long top edge; press, pin, and stitch.

Cut out a 1.3m x 3m rectangle for the walls and a 145cm x 90cm rectangle of blue fabric for the roof. Either fray the edges of the fabric by using a pin to tease out threads parallel to the edge or press under and stitch a narrow hem.</p>\n<p>2 Fold the roof rectangle in half lengthwise and mark the fold with tailor&#146;s chalk. For the roof tiles, draw and cut out a U-shaped paper pattern that is 11cm wide and 10cm deep. Fold a piece of 4m x 4m white felt in half and cut around the pattern through both layers 16 times to make 32 felt tiles. Pin 16 tiles so their straight ends are just to one side of the chalk line on the fabric, and parallel to it (A). Machine-stitch along the straight end of the tiles. Repeat to attach tiles on the other side. Pin and machine-stitch 145cm of cream rickrack near each long edge of this rectangle.</p>\n<p>3 Cut out a 28cm x 25cm rectangle of contrasting fabric for the window pocket. Iron fusible bonding web to the wrong side of a selection of fabrics for the remaining windows and door, and cut out rectangles for them. Make windowpanes for some windows by pinning two lengths of ribbon in a cross shape and folding the ends to the back of the window rectangles, then machine stitch in place (B). For the pocket, turn under and press a narrow hem on all four edges, machine stitching in place on the top edge.</p>\n<p>4 Fold the house rectangle in half crosswise and fold the roof rectangle in half along the line between the tiles. Lay them both on a work surface, with the roof in position. Remove the backing paper, and pin the door and windows to the house fabric (C). Iron in place, removing the pins as you go. Now remove the roof, unfold the house, and machine stitch around the edges of the doors and windows. Leave the top edge of the pocket unstitched.</p>\n<p>5 From the fabric you backed with fusible web in step 3, cut out windowsills, a house number, and a letterbox (D). Remove the backing paper and iron them in place on the house fabric &#150; iron only the top edge of the letterbox so that it can flap.</p>\n<p>6 For a finishing touch, add an embroidered climbing plant.</p>\n<p>7 Peg over a clothesline to use.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/nt/PR-playhse-diagrams400sq.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/r5/PR-Homemade-Home-for-CHildren-book-150x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" /></h3>\n<p><strong>This project is taken from 'The Homemade Home for Children' by Sania Pell (Cico Books, &#163;16.99). <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781908170194\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy the book from the Allaboutyou online bookshop, with free P&P</a></strong></p>\n<h3>&#160;</h3>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/countryliving/countryliving-events/Country-Living-craft-projects-for-children\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see all of the craft projects for children in Country Living's May 2012 issue</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/making/craft-ideas-children-decorate-children-rooms\" target=\"_blank\">More easy craft ideas for children's rooms</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-10T12:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"2","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"7.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jsomma","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7698224","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2011-12-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-07-19T14:00:52.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/Make-clothesline-playhouse","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Fabric flowers, leaves and embroidery","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"Country Living, flower wall-hanging, Sania Pell","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Make a flower wall-hanging","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-07-30T10:56:31.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"636","teaser":"Fabric flowers, leaves and embroidery","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Fabric flowers, leaves and embroidery combine to make a dramatic wall hanging, designed by Sania Pell","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"sew-embroidered-wall-hanging","description":"Make a flower wall-hanging designed by Sania Pell, another pretty craft project for children, from Country Living, on allaboutyou.com &#150; The online home of Good Housekeeping, Prima, Coast and House Beautiful.

Fray the top and bottom edges by using a pin to tease out threads parallel to these edges.</p>\n<p>2 Following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, iron fusible web to the back of scraps of print and solid-colour fabrics. Using small, sharp scissors, cut out a number of simple flower heads, leaves and stems from the fabrics illustration A). You don&#8217;t need a stem for every flower head, because some of the stems will be machine embroidered.) For more intricate leaf shapes, you could use leaves from silk flowers or even real leaves as patterns, pinning them to fabric and cutting around.</p>\n<p>3 Take a number of silk flowers and remove their stems. Arrange the silk and fabric flower heads, fabric leaves and stems on the linen. The stems should all finish at the bottom edge of the linen. Pin all the fabric shapes in place. Mark with pencil or tailor&#8217;s chalk where the silk flowers will go.</p>\n<p>4 Remove the backing paper from the fabric shapes and iron in place on the linen.</p>\n<p>5 Machine embroider the remaining flower stems using a wide zigzag stitch.</p>\n<p>6 Hand-embroider the leaf detail using running stitch and embroidery thread in a shade darker than the leaf colour.</p>\n<p>7 Hand-sew each silk flower in place so the stitches won&#8217;t show.</p>\n<p>8 Make ties to suspend the hanging by cutting two strips of print fabric or ribbon, fold them in half crosswise, and sew the folded end of each securely to the front of the linen at the top corners.

Fagan was a miracle I was not prepared for. On a hot summer night, midway through my lecture tour across the Midwest, the warm scent of corn, pond water, and dirt filled the tent where a crowd of farmers waited for Annie to lead me up the steps and call out the story of my life. As I stood at the base of the three wooden steps leading to the stage, I gripped the stair railing &#151; its cool metal vibrated with the shuffle, then stomp, of heavy boots, an angry tint to the air. The crowd had been waiting for a half hour. \"I can't do it,\" Annie spelled into my palm. \"I just can't.\" A cough rattled her chest, and she doubled over beside me. At last, Annie rallied. On the rickety stage, she cut short her introduction of me. Her hand shook in mine as she called out to the crowd, \"I bring you Helen Keller, the miracle.\" </p><p>Annie and I sat onstage, despondent over the crowd's unfriendly response to that night's lecture, when Peter slid into the billowing, creaking tent. In the night his scent came easily to me: typewriter ink, cigarette smoke, and the strange muskrat smell I always associated with men. A family member back East found Peter to be my private secretary until Annie got better. Annie spelled the telegram into my palm: \"Work experience: laid-off <i>Boston Herald </i>reporter. Special qualifications: Long on time, short on cash. Wants the job.\" He'd even learned finger-spelling. </p><p>I held the edge of my chair and felt his footsteps as he swung closer. \"Is he handsome?\" I asked Annie, nervously smoothing my hair.</p><p>\"All I can say is, thank God you're blind,\" she spelled. We both laughed.</p><p>\"Is he that bad?\" I spelled back into her hand &#151; familiar as my own. I cocked my head. Peter felt closer. Annie said, shifting in her chair, \"He's looking left, now right.\" Annie went on, her fingers flying in my palm: \"His shirt is unbuttoned. And he's got that shifty look of a person ready to flee.\"</p><p>\"Flee?\" I leaned closer to Annie.</p><p>\"His family fled Ireland,\" Annie went on. \"The famine. He's a Socialist now,\" she told me. \"Another supporter of lost causes &#151; like you.\" </p><p>We both laughed again, but I felt a slight mocking in her palm. \"Do I look all right?\" Always I've liked men better than women; even at age 7 I'd ask Annie to make me pretty. Now, dress tugged down, I sat up straighter.</p><p>\"He doesn't see you,\" she rapped. \"But he is looking. He's turning this way. Dark hair, he's shaking his jacket off his shoulders, and oh, brown eyes.\" Relief washed through me as Peter rounded the table. Through the soles of my shoes I felt the<i> sssaah, sssaah</i> of his boots until he swung up to the table and grasped my hand.</p><p>\"Miss <i>Kel</i>-ler, a pleasure to see you.\" I touched his throat and felt a twinge, very slight, that moved to the center of my heart. His voice, rough as twine, thrummed through my fingertips. I felt incapable of taking my hand away. With my ring finger on his larynx and my forefinger on the stubble of his cheek, I felt his parted lips with my thumb. Annie always told me, \"For God's sake, Helen, when you're touching a man's face, move fast: Read his words, then drop your hand. People gawk enough without seeing you lingering over some man's drawl.\"</p><p>But Peter drew me <i>in.</i></p><p>\"The pleasure is mine,\" I spelled into his rough palm.</p><p>\"The famous Helen Keller,\" he repeated. \"I've been following the press on you: a sold-out lecture tour across Canada, and now this tour &#151; two lectures a day, 25 cities, three different states. All in the service of raising money for the blind. Am I right?\" That night, under the hot dome of the tent on Wisconsin's lakeshore, I grasped Peter's hand in mine and felt the delicacy of his fingers. </p><p>He didn't know the whole story &#151; how could he know that my father had stopped paying Annie's salary when I was 10 years old, and that since my graduation from Radcliffe College, Annie and I had done our show in too many cities to count to pay the bills? We had to keep ourselves afloat. </p><p>\"I'm so glad,\" I blurted out, \"that you're here to help us.\"</p><p>He just threw his head back and laughed, his vibrating throat a lush drink of creamy milk. \"Yes, I'm engaged in the important mission of taking over for Miss Sullivan and getting you two safely home,\" he said. And I believed him. </p><p>Peter turned to Annie. \"I'll take her to dinner if you'd like.\" As always when I was with two people, I held Annie's hand with my left hand and listened as she spelled. At the same time I held my other hand to Peter's lips and lip-read his response. His mouth moved quickly, excitedly, under my fingers; Annie's spelling &#151; usually up to 80 words per minute poured into my palm &#151; was weary.</p><p>Peter looped his arm through mine and led me. Just as we stood at the tent's edge, the cool night air hit me: It was filled with the vibrations of the dinner bell &#151; pulsing and fading on Lake Bally's shores. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Starving,\" I said right back. </p><p>The bell stopped tolling, leaving a fist of empty air &#151; and I can tell you now what I did not know then: That bell was just like Peter. Booming with joy. But soon empty. Gone. I held his hand more fiercely in mine. </p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"973098","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/EX/05012-helen-keller-in-love-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Sultan","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564039","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/facts-about-helen-keller\">10 Things You Didn't Know About Helen Keller </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/helen-keller-in-love\">Helen in Love </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/weight-loss/helen-phillips-weight-loss-success\">How Biggest Loser Winner Helen Phillips Lost 140 Lbs.</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/helens-kitchen-veggie-fajita-bowl-187\">Helen's Kitchen Veggie Fajita Bowl</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/helens-kitchen-fiesta-black-bean-bowl-190\">Helen's Kitchen Fiesta Black Bean Bowl</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/diet-plans/biggest-loser-workout\">Biggest Loser Winning Workout and Meal Plan</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/pictures-of-celebrities\">Pictures of Celebrities from Good Housekeeping 's Shine On Event</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/katie-couric-advice\">Graduation Wisdom for Grown-Ups</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/weight-loss/advice-from-the-biggest-loser\">Secrets from The Biggest Loser</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/weight-loss/biggest-loser-ranch-behind-the-scenes\">At The Biggest Loser Ranch</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:38:25.000Z","author_id":"37960","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/blogs-books/helen-keller-in-love","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Your mom and dad's financial status can impact your own budget.

That's a lot of green. Now, money in itself is a touchy subject for most families; add to that the dramatic role reversal that can occur as our parents need our care, and you've got a very tough topic. Let me make it a bit easier to have the talk and ensure parents' financial health with these three strategies:</p>\n<p><strong>Mistake: Ignoring your parents' budget</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't know whether your parents are keeping up with their expenses or what kind of income they are living on &#151; and the size of their nest egg (if they even have one) &#151; then it's time to go on a fact-finding mission so you can help them avoid financial trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Move to Make: Do some research about your mother and father's finances </strong></p>\n<p>First, break the ice by talking about your own budget: \"We've had to adapt our budget a bit due to the economy.... How are you doing? Are things the same every month?\" This worked swimmingly with my own normally tight-lipped 70-year-old father, who was more than happy to dish.</p>\n<p>Monthly income is an important starting point. Ask them, \"What are your Social Security payments?\" for a solid budget baseline. And ask, \"Are you drawing the same amount from your retirement savings every month?\" Upticks in withdrawal amounts could mean they're falling behind financially. Also ask about any other sources of income, such as a pension or other state or local benefits. At a site of the National Council on Aging, <a href=\"http://www.benefitscheck.org/\" target=\"_blank\">benefitscheck.org</a>, you can find out if your parents would qualify for any assistance they may not have thought of in paying for expenses such as health care, heating and cooling, cell phones, and food. These questions will guide you as to what funds your parents are pulling from every month.</p>\n<p>Next, run through your parents' bills with them to see if they are in the red every month or if they're breaking even. The script for navigating bills without simply seeming nosy varies. You could offer a helping hand: \"Mom, I found a new system I love for organizing my bills &#151; can I share it with you?\" Or, if that might be a minefield, try commiserating: \"My phone bill jumped a lot this month &#151; what about yours?\"</p>\n<p>If you find that your mom and dad are losing ground each month, focus on the culprit and create a plan. Is overspending to blame? If so, help them cut back with advice from AARP (go to <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">aarp.org</a> and search for \"99 great ways to save\"). Is the issue too little savings or a big drop in the value of retirement investments, meaning a lower income? Before you get ready to dole out any cash, ask if your parents work with a financial adviser or planner. If so, ask if you may attend the next meeting. If not, it could be very worthwhile to sit down together with one, even for just one session ($150 and up) in which you could create a focused plan for tweaks to make. To find a certified financial planner (CFP) near you, you can head to the website <a href=\"http://www.fpanet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">fpanet.org</a>; visit <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">adviserinfo.sec.gov</a> (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to check advisers' backgrounds.</p>\n<p>If credit card debt is an issue, guide your parents to <a href=\"http://www.nfcc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">nfcc.org</a> (they can also call 800-388-2227) to find a nearby nonprofit credit counselor; join them in a meeting to see what inexpensive options could help pay off their debt.</p>\n<p>Also offer to call up lenders yourself to get them to lower interest rates and/or consolidate accounts. Yes, this requires time and effort on your part, but becoming your parents' advocate when it comes to debt actually benefits all of you.</p>\n<p><strong> Next: <a href=\"/family/budget/health-care-options\">Know your parents' healthcare options</a> </strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"971052","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/ns/pink-piggy-bank-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Wong Ulrich","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-carmen-wong-ulrich","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564019","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/managing-parents-money\">Protect Your Parents' Money </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/healthcare-costs\">10 Ways to Save on Health Care </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/new-healthcare-reform-act\">The New Health -Care Reform Act: You Could Be Paying Less</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/reduce-medical-costs\">15 Ways to Reduce Medical Costs </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/pet-care-tips\">Money -Saving Pet-Care Tips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/125-tips-to-save-money\">125 Ways to Manage Your Money </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/women-veterans-health-care\">Help Women Veterans Get the Health Care They Need</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/work-careers/self-employed-health-insurance\">Health Insurance for the Self-Employed</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-questions-answered\">The 10 Money Questions I'm Always Asked</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/low-cost-pet-care\">Slash Pet-Care Costs </a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:38:17.000Z","author_id":"11564","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/budget/managing-parents-money","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","checked_out_by":"jgallardo","keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"WDY Nav Bar Promotion -

Impassive and unyielding as a figure on Easter Island, formed from the hard years when he raised himself and his hard years as a basketball star and many more hard years in the ROTC and National Guard, Brown's game face is all the more impressive in person. Add his perfectly gray hair and his cowboy eyes pinched against the noonday glare and he looks at fifty-two like a United States senator exemplified. His many years of hard work and service to his community add a certain moral authority, too &#151; it's not like he's some schmuck.</p>\n<p>And yet Scott Brown is defensive today, and the trait makes him somewhat smaller as the minutes in his presence tick by. For instance, every time he mentions his opponent in the Massachusetts Senate race, he makes a populist dig against her education. \"It doesn't take a Harvard degree to understand\" his offer to ban false and misleading advertising from the race, he says. Why won't \"Professor Warren\" agree? This would sound right in the mouth of Newt Gingrich, perhaps, but it seems a bit strange from a Massachusetts moderate who himself holds fancy degrees from Tufts and Boston College.</p>\n<p>\"With all due respect,\" Brown responds in a voice that is almost aggressively calm and cool, \"everyone calls her professor. It's like saying Captain So-and-So or Doctor So-and-So. I don't think it's weird at all.\"</p>\n<p>And every time he mentions Elizabeth Warren, he also says that she is a \"self-proclaimed rock thrower\" who has said she wants to leave \"blood and teeth on the floor.\" This strategy comes from a preposterous ad put out by the Massachusetts GOP that shows ominous darkened shots of Warren's schoolmarm face fading into Occupy Wall Street protesters screaming for revolution. \"Marxism is the way to go! Capitalism is killing this country!\"</p>\n<p>So despite the awesome imperturbability of that game face, despite the touch of ice that seeps into his calm perfection, Brown is a man uncomfortable behind his eyes as he grimly sticks to a message he thinks might win him reelection as a Republican in the most Democratic state in the country, in the most important election of the year, save for the presidential ballot line. To argue with Brown for a moment, it is actually very clear that Warren was speaking metaphorically when she said that there would be \"blood and teeth on the floor\" if her brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, wasn't authorized by Congress. Isn't it a touch false and misleading &#151; especially for someone who constantly denounces false and misleading political advertising &#151; to suggest that a law-abiding middle-aged mom who teaches law at Harvard is actually calling for a violent revolution in the streets?</p>\n<p>To be successful in politics at this level, you must debase yourself and say some things that you don't believe. There are too many competing interests in America and in Washington to be exempt from playing this game. And to be truly successful, you must make your debasement seem born of true conviction. If you are Barack Obama, you must say that you oppose gay marriage and that your position on the issue is \"evolving,\" when that simply isn't true. If you are Brown's fellow Bay State Republican Mitt Romney, you say that the one thing most people know about you is that you are a man of \"constancy,\" and you say it without shame or discomfort, even as your audience erupts with laughter at the lie. And when you are Senator Scott Brown &#151; the self-made man who decided after Ted Kennedy died that his next step along life's path would be to seize the Kennedy family Senate seat for himself &#151; you say things about your opponent that make her sound like Che Guevara. \"She's made it very publicly known those are her quotes,\" he insists, \"directly from her. She said that she created the intellectual foundation for Occupy Wall Street, and she supports it.\"</p>\n<p>Yes, but <em>what</em> does she support about them?</p>\n<p>\"She supports the entire movement. The entire movement &#151; \"</p>\n<p>But what <em>specifically</em>? The right to camp on public property?</p>\n<p>\"Whatever they stand for,\" he throws out impatiently. \"What do they stand for? They don't like borders. They want to forgive all debt.\"</p>\n<p>The thing is, as he sits here in his campaign office, located in the Mass Victory headquarters of the Massachusetts state Republican party in a warehouse district in Boston, Brown is essentially a man without a party. In late 2009, as his campaign against a moribund career Democrat caught fire, Brown became the beneficiary of all the anti-Obama feeling in the country, as there was only one election going on anywhere in January 2010, only one way to rage against the White House, and it was in Massachusetts. As such, Brown became the first and most potent demonstration of the power of the so-called Tea Party, which to that point had been only theoretical. Brown crisscrossed the state, boasting that his would be the vote that would prevent the president from passing his \"government takeover of the health-care industry,\" and it was the Tea Party rage that swept him to victory. \"The first time I ever picked up a political sign was to support Scott Brown,\" says North Shore Tea Party chairman Carlos Hernandez. The next morning Brown woke up, a Republican in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>Senator Brown is a smart man, and he knew he wouldn't be able to sashay around like some Tea Party yo-yo and survive. Brown had also promised to be bipartisan and independent, a \"Scott Brown Republican\" who always put the interests of the people of Massachusetts first and never blindly followed the Republican party line. Yes, the first thing he did in Washington was vote against Obama's health-care reform, which sent the Tea Partiers into ecstasy and Ted Kennedy spinning in his grave. Then he consulted reality and his chances of reelection and immediately tacked left, backing Wall Street reform and the jobs bill and Obama's recess appointments and the START treaty and many other things that true conservatives claimed to despise. At the State of the Union, he was seen on television grabbing President Obama's hand and holding on to it for a long time. Now Carlos Hernandez has another name for Brown:</p>\n<p>\"I call him Benedict Arnold.\"</p>\n<p>So now Brown's an apostate to the conservatives who are currently driving the politics, and the Democrats have produced a rock star as their nominee, and the perfect moment that produced his election all the way back in 2010 seems like an irreproducible aberration, a tear in the fabric of time that is all the way across the universe by now. And Senator Brown is left to convince the voters of his state that of the candidates in the race, he is the reasonable one, the one who would better be able to work with President Obama than a senator from the president's own party. And that means that on this day, in the empty Mass Victory GOP headquarters, he is left to play small ball, quibbling about who was more responsible for Elizabeth Warren's signature creation, her or him.</p>\n<p>Warren became famous in the first place &#151; and established a national following &#151; for creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the wake of the financial collapse of 2008 to, among other things, stop big banks and payday lenders from using the fine print of contracts to screw their customers. Once in the Senate, Brown voted to authorize the agency's creation. So why the heck is he now talking about blood in the streets?</p>\n<p>Brown doesn't blink an eye. \"She didn't do the Consumer Protection Bureau. If not for my vote, she never would have had that opportunity to participate in the Consumer Protection Bureau.\"</p>\n<p>A pivotal question in this campaign is how much of a stomach does he have for the contortions required in 2012 for someone like him to survive in a place like this. When he says that thing he just said about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, his tone is so confident, so serene, it's almost impossible to resist. You could follow this man into battle and feel safe in the halo of his strength. You know that just listening to him, and it's impressive until you recover and return to the objective fact that Warren conceived of the consumer agency and lobbied relentlessly for its passage through Congress, so with respect to the one actual real-world thing she has done &#151;</p>\n<p>\"We agree,\" he says.</p>\n<p>He capitulates so quickly and so offhandedly, it almost seems like he didn't say it. You agree?</p>\n<p>The expression on his face is pure basketball, a dead-eye stare-down. \"So we agree on something. We are going to agree on things, absolutely.\"</p>\n<p>So the rhetoric of rocks &#151;</p>\n<p>\"It's not rhetoric,\" he snaps. \"These are things she actually <em>said.</em> She's very famously known for wanting to leave blood and teeth on the streets. These are the things that she said.\"</p>\n<p>Poignancy and politics almost never meet.</p>\n<p>Scott Brown's dilemma might actually be poignant.</p>\n\n\n<p><b><i>ON THE POLITICS BLOG: <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/scott-brown-esquire-interview-7455178\">More from Esquire's Scott Brown Interview</a></i></b><br /><i>(Profile continues on next page....)</i></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-09T22:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"1060","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Richardson","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mattsullivan","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"Two years ago, propelled by Tea Party rage, Scott Brown won Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.

SALAMONE","category":[{"__total_count__":1,"category":"FEATURES"}],"storytext":"By GINA SALAMONE new york daily news As theatrical as the King of Pop's performances were, pairing his music and dance moves with Cirque du Soleil makes for an even more over-the-top show. \"Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour\" arrived for three shows at the Prudential Center in Newark before heading to Madison Square Garden and Nassau Coliseum today. More than 65 performing artists, including acrobats, musicians and dancers, bring the late pop star's songbook to life on a colorful fantasy set. Cirque boasts that it's the biggest arena show touring North America right now, with 35 trucks, eight buses and more than 215 people.\"Michael Jackson always wanted to work with Cirque du Soleil,\" says Tara Young, artistic director for the tour. \"When he was alive, he had many, many thoughts of actually collaborating with Cirque.\"The arts and entertainment company partnered with Jackson's estate after his death in 2009 to produce a show that would pay tribute to him.\"When he passed, it was actually almost something that was obviously going to happen,\" Young said. Young has been on board since the tour kicked off Oct. 2 in Montreal. The show has been scaled back a little because of technical glitches.\"Everybody reached really high for this show for what they wanted to do,\" Young said. \"We had to get rid of some things, but it's honestly due to moving so fast. We had 40 trucks.\"So you're loading at 4 a.m., and then you have 15,000 people showing up at 7 p.m.,\" she adds. \"There are only so many hours in the day to unload those trucks and set up a show. And then you have to leave two days later sometimes, and travel 17 hours to the next city.\"So the show was streamlined. \"In honesty, I don't miss the things that have gone away because it really is about Michael and his life and his music,\" Young says. \"The show is tighter and the rhythm is far better than when we started.\"The show has the vibe of a rock concert, and producers have hired choreographers Jackson worked with.\"When you see the show, you actually feel like you are seeing a Michael Jackson concert,\" said Young. \"But then you have a strap artist in the air, hanging on by his mouth. So Cirque has brought in these artists who have broken world records. And dancing to Michael Jackson music in the air is really something.\"We also have dancers on the ground, of course, doing his iconic choreography,\" she adds. \"For example, 'Smooth &#8232;Criminal' is very similar to seeing the music video. And 'Thriller' has many of the same steps because it was done by the same people who did the video.\"Young believes audience members will be blown away by the acrobatics. \"I don't want to give specifics because I want people to be drawn in,\" Young says. \"But there's a group from Japan that are doing something onstage that's never been seen before here.\"Brooklyn-born dancer Leo Moctezuma, 31, performs in the show. He dances to songs like \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"Dangerous.\"\"Aside from being a featured dancer in the show, I'm filling in for one of the Fanatics characters,\" he says. \"They're five big Michael fans. We start the show off in different costumes that are Michael-inspired.\"I have a red 'Thriller' jacket and glittery gold socks underneath my pants,\" he adds. \"And I have a big WWF belt that's gold. I'm in all the huge production numbers that involve dancing.\"Moctezuma also performs an \"aerial tango\" to the Jacksons' song \"This Place Hotel.\"\"So the girls harness, and there's wrist loops, so we hang from our wrists and do different moves in the air partnering with the girls,\" he explains. \"That's one of my favorite parts of the show.\"But the heart of the show is Jackson's voice, according to Michael Phillips, a 38-year-old saxophonist. His favorite moment is one in which a young Jackson appears on the big screen singing the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There.\"\"It's a subtle moment,\" Phillips says. \"It doesn't have any pyrotechnics. The keyboard player starts playing 'I'll Be There,' and then all of a sudden the old-school Michael with the Afro is on screen singing extremely passionately. Everybody's just in awe.\"You can hear a pin drop, because people are remembering that this was just a little kid who was extremely talented who had the opportunity to share his music with the whole world,\" he adds. \"It's one of the most innocent and gut-wrenching moments of the show.\"The performance bounces back and forth between the pop star's soul songs and dance numbers.\"We go through different moods, so we party and then all of a sudden we're down in a reflective type of vibe,\" Phillips says. Originally from Westchester, and now living in Portland, Ore., Phillips has toured with Prince and Stevie Wonder. This is the sax player's first Cirque production, and he also plays the EWI (electronic wind instrument) onstage. He and the rest of the band are elevated from the main stage, looking down at the other performers. They play along to everything, from the Jacksons' \"Can You Feel It\" to \"ABC\" by the Jackson 5.\"No matter how much good music you pick, there's always going to be some good music missing because of Michael's extensive body of work,\" Phillips points out. \"You just can't play everything.\""}],"article_type_name":"News Article","publish_date":"2012-04-08T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":"CIRQUE28F_715010","template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"webuser","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":null,"article_type_prefix":"news","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7698287","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1011","last_updated_date":"2012-03-29T18:50:10.000Z","author_id":"8457","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"newsconsortium","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2022-03-29T18:50:10.000Z","origin_site_name":"News Consortium","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.newsconsortium.com/news-cirque28f_715010-027bdd2279d011e1af4aa861e9e876f7","issue_date":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"566","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://newsconsortium.hearstdigital.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Brooklyn Wok Shop does Chinese?food with flair, and cocktails, too","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":null,"headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"581","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"566","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"news-wok25f_708342-8693bb5a78e211e19e418446e9e876f7","description":null,"page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-03-28T14:10:11.000Z","title":"Brooklyn Wok Shop does Chinese?food with flair, and cocktails, too","custom_canonical":null,"allow_comment":"1","meta_title":null,"contributor_email":null,"author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"566","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"sragan","last_name":"Unknown","email":null,"creation_date":"2009-05-20T20:20:43.000Z","id":"8457","last_updated_date":"2009-05-20T20:20:43.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Unknown"},"import_section_id":null,"body":[{"images":"","byline":"PATTY LEE","category":[{"__total_count__":1,"category":"FEATURES"}],"storytext":"BY PATTY LEE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS A new Williamsburg eatery is putting an elevated spin on takeout classics like General Tso's chicken and beef and broccoli. Run by husband-and-wife duo Edric and Melissa Har, Brooklyn Wok Shop has updated Chinese - and Chinese-American - staples using high-end techniques and fresh ingredients.The result: pliant egg noodles, generously stuffed wontons and melt-in-your-mouth roast pork, all made in-house.\"We play with how there are two menus at Chinese restaurants. We have the American side with the General Tso's chicken and the more authentic stuff like wonton soup and beef short rib,\" says Edric.The idea came to the Hars, who moved to Williamsburg two years ago, when nothing in their new neighborhood satisfied late-night cravings for Chinese food.\"Edric and I used to live on Spring St., which was a few blocks from Chinatown, so we were spoiled,\" says Melissa. \"We tried a lot of the Asian restaurants here too and they're good, but we wanted to open up a place where we wanted to eat every day.\"Edric, a chef whose r&#233;sum&#233; includes stints at Le Bernardin, Veritas and Cru, has little training in Chinese cooking - but plenty of fond memories about growing up in Chinatown.\"My mom was a great cook and my godparents, who also raised me, are Italian, so I would have Sunday gravy and cold cut sandwiches. I had these two great worlds and cultures,\" he remembers. \"While I'm not a Chinese chef per se, I still have those food memories. We all do.\"And making egg noodles, after all, isn't too different from making pasta, says Edric, who was trained in French and Italian techniques.Luckily, Melissa's aunts and uncles have been running Chinese takeout joints in Orlando for years. Her dad is also a chef.\"My first job, at 14 years old, was working at a takeout restaurant,\" says Melissa, who now runs front of house. \"It's come back full circle.\"The couple took a trip down South and Edric spent a week working with his in-laws in addition to doing research on his own.Staying true to his culinary background, Edric continues to cook with classic French steel pans.\"If you give me a wok, I'm screwed, but give me six burners and an oven, I can basically do anything,\" he laughs.Brooklyn Wok Shop also sources ingredients from well-known purveyors like Pino's Prime Meats, a butcher shop &#173;located on Sullivan St.\"The reason I worked at a place was because the ingredients are great,\" says Edric. \"I feel like it always comes through in the flavor. It tastes more like you imagine it to be.\"\"We want to elevate Chinese food so you're not eating mystery meat and wondering where it came from,\" adds Melissa. \"A lot of people come in here and go, 'Oh my God, I'm so glad your wontons are filled with meat.'&#8201;\"The Hars are also having fun with the flavors of their childhood - Edric's latest creation is the Sriracha-lada, an Asian spin on the Michelada.Soon, Brooklyn Wok Shop will also debut a dim sum-inspired brunch menu and more cocktails, including a lychee white sangria.\"We don't want to be too serious about food,\" says Edric. \"Is it authentic? Maybe not 100%. Is it good? It's great.\" Brooklyn Wok Shop  182 N. 10th St., Williamsburg, (347) 889-7992."}],"article_type_name":"News Article","publish_date":"2012-04-08T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":"WOK25F_708342","template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"webuser","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":null,"article_type_prefix":"news","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7675074","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1011","last_updated_date":"2012-03-28T14:30:11.000Z","author_id":"8457","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"newsconsortium","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2022-03-28T14:30:11.000Z","origin_site_name":"News Consortium","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.newsconsortium.com/news-wok25f_708342-8693bb5a78e211e19e418446e9e876f7","issue_date":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The myth is that it has to cook all day.

But it's also a sensible between-seasons dish while we wait for the markets to fill with spring's early greens. A good Bolognese is vibrant enough to wake us from the hibernating foods of winter and satisfying enough to bridge that unpredictable gap when the weather isn't quite as warm as we think it is.</p>\n<p>As complex as the flavor is, this Bolognese is a straightforward, short-simmered sauce. The most important moment comes cooking the pasta itself, a single step that can make the dish great or just okay. Executing this step properly will allow the spaghetti's starch to flow into the sauce and the sauce to flow into the spaghetti: It's osmosis, and it's the way spaghetti Bolognese is supposed to taste.</p>\n<h3>PORK BOLOGNESE</h3>\n<p><em>Chef Nick Anderer, Maialino, New York</em></p>\n<p>Yield: About 10 cups</p>\n<p>&#149; 2 tbsp olive oil</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;4 lbs pork shoulder, ground</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;&#188; lb prosciutto, ground or diced small</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;Vegetable mix: 1 cup carrots, 1 cup red onions, 1 cup celery, all diced small</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;3 garlic cloves, minced</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;2 tsp black peppercorns and 1 tsp fennel seeds, coarsely ground with mortar and pestle</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 tsp red-chile flakes</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 small bunch fresh thyme</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 bay leaf</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;&#189; cup tomato paste</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 cup dry white wine</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;2 cups low-sodium chicken stock (with extra in reserve)</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 28-oz can whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand with all juices reserved</p>\n<p>&#149; Parmigiano-Reggiano rind (removed before grating cheese)</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 tsp sugar</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 cup heavy cream</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;2 tbsp red-wine vinegar</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;Coarse salt to taste</p>\n<p><strong> In a heavy stewpot </strong>or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over high heat and lightly brown the pork in batches, seasoning with salt each time. Don't overcrowd the pot, which will re-sult in pale steamed pork. But don't brown it too aggressively, either, as this will dry out the meat. It should simply lose its color and be evenly crumbled. Depending on the size of your pot, it will require roughly three batches, each time transferring the meat to a plate or sheet tray. Do not discard the fat!</p>\n<p><strong>In the same pot,</strong> over medi-um heat, add prosciutto, vegetables, and garlic. After a few minutes, add the ground pepper and fennel, chile flakes, thyme, and bay leaf, and cook for 1 minute to extract all the flavor from the herbs and spices. (I don't like making sachets with cheesecloth for the herbs; you can pick out the stems later. You'll get more flavor by cooking them naked with the vegetables.)</p>\n<p><strong>Add the tomato paste </strong>and cook for a few minutes until it deepens in color, stirring frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Deglaze by adding wine and scraping any browned tomato paste from pot, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half.</p>\n<p><strong>Add the chicken stock</strong> and canned tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and add the meat (and the fat!) and the rind you cut off the Parmigiano. Add the sugar, taste the sauce, and adjust if more salt is necessary. You don't need to simmer for hours: 45 minutes is plenty. (It should look like chili.) If the liquid ever evaporates to the point where the meat is not covered, add more stock sparingly.</p>\n<p><strong>After 40 minutes,</strong> skim off some but not all of the fat, add heavy cream, stirring thoroughly to incorporate, and simmer for another 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Remove pot</strong> from heat, and if you can find them, pick out the bay leaf, thyme stems, and any gooey remainder of cheese rind. Taste once more for seasoning and add the vinegar to brighten the flavors.</p>\n<h3><strong>COOKING THE PASTA</strong></h3>\n<p>&#149;&#160;4 cups Bolognese sauce</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 lb spaghetti</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (plus more for the table)</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;3 tbsp good olive oil</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;3 tbsp unsalted butter</p>\n<p>&#149;&#160;&#188; cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>\n<p><strong>In a large skillet</strong> or saut&#233; pan, bring the sauce to a simmer. In a large pot of abundantly salted boiling water, cook the pasta until al dente only, stirring frequently. Don't trust box instructions; taste a noodle yourself and make sure it still has a lot of bite and is even a bit crunchy in the center. Transfer noodles to sauce, dragging a little bit of the pasta water into the sauce as well. (It should be soupy enough that the noodles sink into the sauce, so the Bolognese is simmering around the strands.)</p>\n<p><strong>When the sauce </strong>begins to thicken around the noodles (1 to 2 minutes), add the cheese, oil, butter, and parsley. Remove pan from heat and stir, watching the sauce become velvety and rich. (If the sauce becomes too dense with the addition of the cheese, a small splash of pasta water will loosen it up again.) Serve with more grated cheese on the side. Serves 4.</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-06T19:38:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Maroukian","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mattsullivan","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"The myth of Bolognese sauce is that it has to cook all day.

I started by deciding that my&#160;all-grey color scheme was not possible for spring. Lavender shades and subtle golds would be the newest addition to my humble abode.</p>\n<p>If there's anything I've learned from the Made by Girl blog, it's\nthat a few simple pieces can change an apartment drastically. Step one: a\ncouple of new pieces of art. A canvas with some messy brush strokes priced at\n$3,000? I think not. A trip to Michael's Art Supplies and a few essentials (a\ncanvas and some painting materials), and my slightly-dull living room will\nquickly come to life.</p>\n<p><img class=\"image_id__973954\" title=\"Flowers\" src=\"/cm/seventeen/images/Mn/SEv-style-council-flowers-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" align=\"left\" />If there's one thing that says <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/spring-2012-beauty-products\" target=\"_blank\">spring</a> (and brings life to an\napartment or bedroom), it's your favorite <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/exclusive-interview-linda-flowers\" target=\"_blank\">flowers</a>. I walked over to my local\ndeli, which happens to have a huge selection of gorgeous flowers, and picked up\nsome sunflowers, carnations, and my personal favorite, tulips, and positioned\nthem throughout my apartment. You'd be amazed how much of a difference a little\nbit of <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/fun/quizzes/fun/color-personality-quiz\" target=\"_blank\">color</a> can make!&#160;</p>\n<p>And voila! With a few inexpensive additions, my apartment went\nfrom a gloomy, winter cave to bright and cheery in a few short hours.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>How do you spruce up your space on a budget?

I've spent more time than necessary perusing the pages of <a href=\"http://madebygirl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Made\nby Girl's blog</a> (a blog dedicated to the chicest home design), which probably\nwasn't so great for my newest obsession.&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"image_id__973953\" title=\"Pillow\" src=\"/cm/seventeen/images/er/Sev-spring-tweaks-pillow-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Pillow\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\" />After hours on the internet, and the realization that I was\ndefinitely not getting any <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/college/freshman-15/stay-motivated-in-college\" target=\"_blank\">studying</a> done, I decided to do a little online&#160;window shopping for my apartment inspiration board. I started by deciding that my&#160;all-grey color scheme was not possible for spring. Lavender shades and subtle golds would be the newest addition to my humble abode.</p>\n<p>If there's anything I've learned from the Made by Girl blog, it's\nthat a few simple pieces can change an apartment drastically. Step one: a\ncouple of new pieces of art. A canvas with some messy brush strokes priced at\n$3,000? I think not. A trip to Michael's Art Supplies and a few essentials (a\ncanvas and some painting materials), and my slightly-dull living room will\nquickly come to life.</p>\n<p><img class=\"image_id__973954\" title=\"Flowers\" src=\"/cm/seventeen/images/Mn/SEv-style-council-flowers-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" align=\"left\" />If there's one thing that says <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/spring-2012-beauty-products\" target=\"_blank\">spring</a> (and brings life to an\napartment or bedroom), it's your favorite <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/exclusive-interview-linda-flowers\" target=\"_blank\">flowers</a>. I walked over to my local\ndeli, which happens to have a huge selection of gorgeous flowers, and picked up\nsome sunflowers, carnations, and my personal favorite, tulips, and positioned\nthem throughout my apartment. You'd be amazed how much of a difference a little\nbit of <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/fun/quizzes/fun/color-personality-quiz\" target=\"_blank\">color</a> can make!&#160;</p>\n<p>And voila! With a few inexpensive additions, my apartment went\nfrom a gloomy, winter cave to bright and cheery in a few short hours.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>How do you spruce up your space on a budget?

This technique can be done in different ways like around face (face framing), at the nape (stacked/angled bob), or side swept bangs. When this technique is utilized, it gives movement and structure to your cut.<br /> <strong>Jooge</strong>: In the fashion world, this means detailing &#151;&#160;rubbing the hair between my fingers for texture, or at the roots for a extra lift.<br /> <strong>Fringe</strong>: Bangs<br /> <strong>Point Cut</strong>: When the scissors are used to cut hair vertically instead of horizontally. This will give you a \"piecey\" look.<br /> <strong>Edgy</strong>: Trendy, non-conventional, or extreme. Shapes may include choppy (Rooney Mara in <em>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</em>), asymmetrical (Santigold), or an under cut (Rihanna's short cut/shaved and long on top).<br /> <strong>Gisele Waves</strong>: Gisele Bundchen's waves. Stylists refer to Gisele when we mean loose, tousled waves. It's more about the movement instead of volume.<br /> <strong>Dusting</strong>: Cutting the most minimal amount of hair, otherwise known as the slightest trim for those who are nervous to get a haircut.<br /> <strong>Upsweep:</strong> Loosely gathering hair on the top of the head. This look is ideal for the gym, summer weather, or for protecting hair from rainy weather.<br /> <strong>Faux Hawk:</strong> An edgy look; a messier version of a mohawk.<br /> <strong>Chemical Cut:</strong> Hair so over-processed that it breaks and looks as though it has been cut. <br /> <strong>Busted:</strong> Hair that's overworked, over-processed, and damaged.<br /> <strong>Blunt:</strong> A haircut that is all one length &#150; can be short or long.<br /> <strong>Razored:</strong> A sharp, edgy haircut created with a razor, instead of scissors.<strong></strong><br /> <strong>Bed Head:</strong> Often worn down, this style is a sexy look that makes it look like you effortlessly just arrived to the party and didn't have time to style your hair. A very appealing and natural hairdo.</p>\n<p><strong>When it comes to color, make sure you know what's up. Celebrity colorist <a href=\"http://canalesalon.com/?page_id=26\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Canale</a> (he does Amanda Bynes) of Canale Salon, defines these phrases to avoid a traumarama:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Paper Thin Highlights</strong>: The subtlest form of highlights &#150; more of a glisten than a noticeable line. <br /> <strong>Gloss</strong>: &#160;Shiny overlay on the hair. &#160;Usually a finishing product for hair color and styling.<br /> <strong>Glaze</strong>: &#160;Semipermanent product used for adding shine and for protecting hair color from fading.<br /> <strong>Color Bath</strong>: &#160;Color applied over lathered up hair to adhear to pourous areas like faded hair, or to blend a highlight. <br /> <strong>Fillers</strong>: These are used to even out hair color before using a permanent color. <br /> <strong>Oxidation</strong>: &#160;A chemical change in hair color caused by air. &#160;This usually results in the the yellowing of bright highlights. <br /> <strong>Dimensional Color</strong>: &#160;Color that brings out the movement of a haircut.<br /> <strong>Tipping</strong>: A lightening technique done by freehand with color. &#160;Usually this technique is reserved for the ends of the hair or tips.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-05T18:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11299","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Acciardo","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kacciardo","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7037927","related_links":"<a href=\"/beauty/hair-dictionary\">Snip-tionary: A Dictionary of Hair Terms </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/ingrown-hairs-040108\">How Do I Get Rid of Ingrown Hairs?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/celebrity/new-moon-beauty-tips\">The Beauties of New Moon</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/ashleys-beauty-hair-haul-video-1543704592001\">Ashley's Beauty Hair Haul Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair-ideas/hair-color-ideas\">Hair Color Ideas</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/beauty-smarties-protect-your-hair-this-summer-video-874078110001\">Beauty Smarties: Protect Your Hair This Summer!!

Formerly the Mint Hotel Westminster, the Doubletree's cool, contemporary exterior stands out in a street with lots of red-brick Victorian residential buildings.</p>\n<h3>What are the rooms like?</h3>\n<p>Our room is compact, but has everything you need, thoughtfully laid out, with the sense of light and space you get from full-length windows. Enjoy the views from the table and chairs by the window: to the right, Battersea Power Station with the sun setting - one of London's finest; to the left, the river busy with boats. And I also enjoyed the sight of Bob, my partner, walking along the road towards the hotel.</p>\n<p>On one of those hotel-dressing-table-cum-desk-cum-useful-shelf is an all-purpose box of tricks: an iMac. As well as going online with the free wi-fi (surely this should be standard in every hotel?), playing music, watching a DVD, this one lets you watch TV too, all easily controlled by a tiny white remote. Tucked away behind a door is an ironing board and iron - much faster to do it yourself than call reception. And there's a kettle with a selection of teas and coffees, all tidied away in a drawer.</p>\n<h3><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/Zn/PR-millbank-lounge-doubletree-hilton-westminster.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"10\" />How's the bed?</h3>\n<p>Reassuringly firm, backed with a comfortably angled wooden headboard with a tasteful throw at the bottom of the bed. Two generous pillows each, plus cushions and bedside lights that control the whole room's lighting.</p>\n<h3>What's in the bathroom?</h3>\n<p>Strictly speaking, it's a shower room - there's no bath, but it's all bright, fresh and clean, with Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries, white bathrobes, and simple controls, so no surprise scalding or freezing in the shower - never a relaxing experience.</p>\n<h3>What about eating and drinking?</h3>\n<p>Sink into a sofa and admire the art in the sleek, sophisticated 'red room', officially known as Millbank Lounge (above), on the first floor.</p>\n<p>We are dinner in a semi-booth seating arrangement in the City Caf&#233; on the ground floor: sculptural lights and intriguing curtaining setting the scene.</p>\n<p>Bob says you can't beat a burger, and his was definitely a contender, served after sweetly yielding scallops.</p>\n<p>I started with silky-smooth butternut squash soup, followed by plump pumpkin ravioli with crisp-fried sage leaves, which left me powerless to resist a tangy passionfruit cr&#232;me brul&#233;e.</p>\n<p>Next morning, we came back to the City Caf&#233;, with a wide choice on the buffet, including breads, crispbread, pastries, cakes, cerals, juices, meats, cheeses and fruit. Muesli for me, with a couple of mini croissants and pains au chocolat, and a cooked breakfast for Bob. Coffee was served in cafeti&#232;res and was good: full and rich-tasting - often a letdown in even the most upmarket of hotels.</p>\n<h3>Anything else?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://countdown.tfl.gov.uk/#|searchTerm=88\" target=\"_blank\">no88 bus route</a> runs down the street, which will take you to Westminster, Whitehall, Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus and Camden Town, or south to Clapham Common.</p>\n<h3>What's nearby?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain\" target=\"_blank\">Tate Britain</a> is a two-minute walk away, with Picasso & Modern British Art on until July. Westminster, home of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/\" target=\"_blank\">Houses of Parliament</a> and <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Westminster Abbey</a> is so close that the pub down the road, the Marquis of Granby, is within the division bell area: when the bell rings MPs have eight minutes to get back to the House to vote. For those with political leanings, the office block across the road is home to Tory party central office, and Smith Square has been the site of previous Labour and Conservative party headquarters. Among the other major sights within walking distance are <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/theroyalresidences/buckinghampalace/buckinghampalace.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Buckingham Palace</a> and <a href=\"http://www.londoneye.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The London Eye</a>.</p>\n<h3>What does it cost?</h3>\n<p>Standard double room rate is from &#163;139.</p>\n<h3>How do I book?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://doubletree1.hilton.com/en_US/dt/hotel/LONWMDI-DoubleTree-by-Hilton-Hotel-London-Westminster-/index.do\" target=\"_blank\">DoubleTree by Hilton Westminster</a>, 30 John Islip Street,&#160;London SW1P 4DD, 020 7630 1000.</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/country/places/hotel-reviews-DoubleTree-by-Hilton-Tower-of-London-review\" target=\"_self\"><strong>See the previous 'Somewhere to stay'...</strong></a></p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/country/places/somewhere-to-stay-57098-London\" target=\"_blank\">Read all of our London hotel reviews</a></p>\n<p>Visiting London this year?

It almost broke her heart. Here, for the first time, Mariska Hargitay shares the tender story of how she adopted her two precious new kids</p>\n<p>Mariska Hargitay is among America's favorite (not to mention highest-paid) TV actresses for one very good reason: her portrayal on <em>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</em> of Olivia Benson, the grave, rarely smiling but deeply compassionate sex-crimes detective.</p>\n<p>So it's happily jarring to enter Hargitay's sprawling but comfy New York City apartment and find...the trappings of a party. Dozens of helium balloons bounce against the ceilings of the living room and office; it was Hargitay's 48th birthday recently, and her husband, actor Peter Hermann (who recently starred in the Broadway play <em>War Horse</em>), surprised her with a hayride-themed party. While the bales of hay have thankfully been removed, those balloons remain a happy reminder of the soiree. A massive teddy bear is also a permanent fixture in the living room.</p>\n<p>\"This is the fun house!\" Hargitay says, buoyant in a Manhattan mom's outfit of black jeans, riding boots, and layered tees that reveals her to be, refreshingly, as normal-size around the midriff as any top actress dares to be.</p>\n<p>Hargitay has had quite a year. She and Hermann adopted a baby, daughter Amaya, now 14 months, and six months later she stunned the public by taking home a second baby, Andrew, now 10 months old.</p>\n<p>Now in the kitchen, Hargitay and the whole family are crammed around a long table, having a lunch of Ethiopian chicken, rice, vegetables, and bread. \"We like trying new cultures,\" she explains, bouncing Amaya &#151; a chocolate-skinned cherub in a birthday-party &#151; worthy dress &#151; on her lap before handing the little girl across the table to tall, handsome Hermann, who cuddles his daughter with enormous tenderness. Skim-milk &#151; pale and with eyelashes to die for, baby Andrew is being cradled in his nanny's arms. At the head of the table is the happy-as-a-clam big bro, August, in the Batman skullcap that rarely leaves his head (it has to be pried off at bedtime). Hargitay and Hermann's biological son, who is nearly 6 years old, obviously relishes his newly expanded family.</p>\n<p>\"August thinks this was all his idea!\" Hargitay says, with a husky laugh. \"He said, 'I want a baby sister,' and Amaya came. Then he said, 'I want a baby brother,' and Andrew came. August is feeling pretty good and pretty powerful!\"</p>\n<p>This is the peppy, straightforward, smiling Hargitay &#151; the un-Olivia, in fact: a woman whose bursting-full life is perhaps not easy, but certainly a source of great joy. Yet the qualities that give her performance as Detective Benson such haunting resonance are just a heartbeat away. As the younger children go for their naps and August heads to his room to play, a more emotional, deeply thoughtful Hargitay comes out. \"I'm not gonna lie,\" she says as she launches into the story behind her burgeoning family. \"There were wrenching moments. I say to everybody, 'Adoption is not for the faint of heart.' \"</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/mariska-hargitay-adoption-2\">Mariska's family plan</a> </strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-04T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"972526","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/Lc/0512-mariska-hargitay-apartment-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Weller","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jgordon","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7564041","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/mariska-hargitay-interview\">Mariska Hargitay : Staying Sane When Life Is Moving Fast</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/mariska-hargitay-rape-kit-backlog\">Message from Mariska Hargitay : The Shame of Rape-Kit Backlogs</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-moms-over-40\">Hottest Celebrity Moms Over 40</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/most-popular-hairstyles\">Most Popular Celebrity Hairstyles of All Time</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/celebrity-hairstyles-natural\">Celebrity Loose &amp; Wavy Hairstyles</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/celebrity-hairstyles-pictures\">Celebrity Hairstyle Gallery</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/celebrity-hairstyles-updo\">Celebrity Updo Hairstyles</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/cooking-tools/cookware-reviews/celebrity-cookware-1007\">Celebrity Cookware</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/celebrity-turnarounds-jun04\">Celebrity Turnarounds</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/hair/best-celebrity-hairstyles-pictures\">Which Celebrity Has the Best Hairstyle?</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:38:25.000Z","author_id":"11814","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/celebrity-interviews/mariska-hargitay-adoption","issue_date":"May 2012","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Day One of the demolition","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":"uk-cmuskoron","keywords":"house extension cost, real homes, getting rid of an asbestos roof, house extension costs, Lauren Floodgate, sandstone tiles","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Our extension cost: off with the roof...","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-04T11:49:23.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Lauren","source_id":"641","teaser":"Day One of the demolition","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"The sun's out and the roof is down, that's the garage roof not the car roof!","pagination_thumb":null,"url_name":"our-extension-cost-demolition-begins","description":"Discover the cost of an extension week by week.

Dismantling our garage is a horrible job as the roof is covered in asbestos cement. I decided to hide indoors whilst the messy work was done but I popped out and helped double bag it before driving it to the dump. A bit of advice for anyone doing the same as us, give your tip a call before paying for any waste to be taken away. I was able to drive it down there and dump it completely free of charge. You just have to prove you live in the county.\n\n </p></p>\n\n<p>The planning officer turned up and took away a copy of the structural calculations for the steels so hopefully they'll agree that the &#163;1,300 we spent on an engineer was well spent.

He has a cunning plan but - surprise surprise - the pump we need is going to cost &#163;1,000 more than we'd thought.\n</p></p>\n\n\n<p>Nest job: decide on flooring for kitchen and bathroom floors.

Scott&#8217;s bold designs have a striking quality about them; they&#8217;re contemporary and masculine without being harsh or cold. In his new book, <em>Outside the Box</em>, the designer reveals his creative process, starting with the sleek, black mood box he fills with shells, textiles, photographs, and other trinkets that inspire him and his clients. Scott introduces each of his interiors this way, from an urban apartment&#8212;which features a box lined with a peacock feather, Bulgari cufflinks, and lush velvet&#8212;to a modern beach house, with its geode-encrusted tablescapes and wooden side tables that mimic the sea glass and other natural elements Scott used as inspiration. Together, the rooms and boxes tell the full story of each project&#8212;and command your attention with every turn of the page.

Here are our freshest fashion tips to live by right now.</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Add punch with peplum</strong>: Nothing's hotter this season, and it's a good thing, too. Peplum flatters most figures by adding shape to any silhouette, and hides small lumps and bumps. This <a href=\"http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/marc-by-marc-jacobs-striped-peplum-top-item-10168290.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Marc Jacobs top</a> would infuse a pencil skirt or seasonal, cropped pants with the perfect fashion-forward detail.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>See and be seen in mint green</strong>: This nail polish is topping every beauty editor's spring must-have list. A simple and affordable update to your wardrobe, mint feels young and fresh, and goes sweetly with pastels and neons alike. Do as the fashion bloggers do, and alternate one or two shades on each finger for twice the fun.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Say yes to neon</strong>: Black and brown handbags will always be in style, but we're storing ours, and bringing out these hot numbers. We both fell in love with this <a href=\"http://rebeccaminkoff.com/shop/what-s-new/neon-mini-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Minkoff purse</a> that would go smashingly with a python shirt. Speaking of python...</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Python is the new leopard</strong>: We've spotted this skin on the savviest style bloggers, and we're totally obsessed. When we got a glimpse of this <a href=\"http://modaoperandi.com/equipment-fw-2012/slim-signature-blouse-66677/\" target=\"_blank\">Equipment blouse</a>, we knew we'd be trading in our leopard print for python print ASAP. Check your local <a href=\"http://www.zara.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zara</a> for options as we've noticed some great python pieces &#151; for less &#151; there too.</p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>Go for the bold, lipstick not gloss</strong>: Make your kisser the focal point by pairing minimal, fresh-faced makeup with super-bright lipstick. A bold lip will enhance any look and outfit in just seconds, so start hunting for your signature shade.</p>\n\n<p>1. <i><a href=\"http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/marc-by-marc-jacobs-striped-peplum-top-item-10168290.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Marc by Marc Jacobs Striped Peplum Top</a>, $318</i> 2. <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Winter-Collection-Candy-Apple/dp/B002ULRAQE\" target=\"_blank\">Essie Mint Candy Apple Polish</a>, $7</i> 3. <i><a href=\"http://rebeccaminkoff.com/shop/what-s-new/neon-mini-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Minkoff Neon Mini M.A.C</a>, $195</i> 4. <i><a href=\"http://modaoperandi.com/equipment-fw-2012/slim-signature-blouse-66677/\" target=\"_blank\">Equipment Slim Signature Blouse</a>, $258</i> 5. <i><a href=\"http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/shaded/168/310/Lipstick/index.tmpl\" target=\"_blank\">MAC Lipstick in Impassioned</a>, $14.50</i></p>\n\n<p><i>Best friends and blogging partners Roberta Oglakchya and Rachel Hurn-Maloney founded <a href=\"http://www.therayandthero.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Ray and the Ro</a> to show off stylish looks, share their wishlists, and break down runway fashion.</i></p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-04-03T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"The Ro","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7677684","related_links":"<a href=\"/fashion/trends/delhi-shopping-guide\">Global Shopping Guide: Delhi</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/dublin-shopping-guide\">Global Shopping Guide: Dublin</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/singapore-shopping-guide\">Global Shopping Guide: Singapore</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/global-shopping-dehli-video-1504947906001\">Global Shopping : Dehli Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/marrakech-shopping-guide\">Global Shopping Guide: Marrakech</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/cyber-monday-online-shopping-tips\">12 Cyber Monday Shopping Tips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/global-shopping-dublin-ireland-video-1304848926001\">Global Shopping : Dublin, Ireland Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/global-shopping-guide-marrakech-video-1192574364001\">Global Shopping Guide: Marrakech Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/best-online-shopping-sites\">40 Best Online Shopping Sites</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/nina-garcia-shopping-tips\">Nina Garcia's Shopping Tips</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T17:28:54.000Z","author_id":"37803","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"marieclaire","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Marie Claire","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/style-blog/best-spring-fashion-trends","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Make budget-friendly waves in shadowy palm-tree prints and psychedelic sun-soaked accessories.","site_id":"21","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com","checked_out_by":"afeuer","keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Surfer Style Under $100","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-04T14:35:13.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sweepstakes/22735","link_text":"21 Drops -

Or a duvet rustle as your partner rolls over. Sometimes it&#8217;s no noise at all. Whatever the cause, there you are, in the middle of the night, wide awake and struggling to get back to sleep. You might get up, go to the bathroom, switch on the light, read, toss and turn, write some emails or just lie there stewing in your own sleepless misery. Pull back the curtains of many bedrooms in Britain and you&#8217;ll find the same story. With an estimated one in three* of us suffering from insomnia or some sort of sleep disorder, a good night&#8217;s sleep is fast becoming a precious commodity &#8211; and one which experts say will become more difficult to achieve as we live longer.</p>\n<p>&#8216;The problem is that sleep is socially invisible,&#8217; says Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University. &#8216;We all know about other aspects of ageing &#8211; your hair will go grey, your skin will get wrinkly, your body shape will change &#8211; but no one talks about how it will affect your sleep.&#8217;</p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the issue of quantity. &#8216;To function well, a baby might need up to 17 hours sleep, a 40-year-old needs approximately seven and a 70 year-old no more than six,&#8217; says Kevin. So getting less sleep as you grow older is a sad, but inevitable reality.</p>\n<p>The problem lies more in the quality. Recent studies by the University of Surrey have revealed that the amount of time spent in deep or non-REM sleep &#8211; the most satisfying, restorative sleep that usually occurs in the middle of the night &#8211; lessened with age. Women especially are vulnerable, with nearly 20 per cent claiming to have a bad night&#8217;s sleep five times a week, as opposed to just eight per cent of men. &#8216;During periods of light sleep you are likely to be woken up by a noise or even just your partner rolling over.,&#8217; adds Kevin.</p>\n<p>The menopause, which can strike any time from your mid forties, can mean all chance of a decent night&#8217;s sleep is virtually gone. &#8216;At this point, there&#8217;s a drop in oestrogen and progesterone and a general hormonal imbalance which can disrupt sleep, skew your internal temperature and make you more vulnerable to stress,&#8217; says Matthew Walker, professor of Neurology at London&#8217;s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.</p>\n<p>Add to this hot flushes, which have you waking up in a hot sweat, pumped up with an accompanying surge of adrenalin, and broken nights are par for the course. And while experts say that women are more used to disturbed sleep, thanks to their biological role as nurturers (having periods, babies, wakeful children and the like) and social role as care-givers (which means they worry more), our sleep deprivation is having an impact on all areas of our lives. The 2010 Great British Sleep Survey revealed four times as many insomnia sufferers reporting relationship difficulties and more than 80 per cent saying they regularly experienced low moods. &#8216;Sleep has an effect on the chemicals in the brain which are necessary for laying down memories, building up proteins and essentially repairing your body,&#8217; says Professor Walker. &#8216;If you&#8217;re deprived of sleep, it&#8217;s much harder to cope with everything around you.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Yoga and meditation expert Alison Francis (<a href=\"http://www.anandi.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.anandi.co.uk</a>) blames the growth in sleep problems on today&#8217;s&#160;fast-paced society and the pressures we face. &#8216;Women often think they have to do it all perfectly with work, children and relationships. Something has to give, and that something can often be sleep,&#8217; Alison says.</p>\n<p>When women come to her feeling stressed out and exhausted, she recommends an ancient yoga practice called Nidra. &#8216;It is a conscious physiological and psychological relaxation of the whole system which takes half an hour and is worth four hours&#8217; sleep at least,&#8217; she says. The practice involves sitting on a floor or yoga mat somewhere quiet, bringing your focus inwards and systematically going round each part of your body from head to toe, breathing in and out of your nose, and relaxing it.&#8217;</p>\n<p>She also stresses the importance of a healthy, balanced diet, and one which incorporates lots more of the essential amino acid, tryptophan, found in foods such as turkey, milk, bananas, avocados and pasta. &#8216;This helps to produce serotonin, the neurotransmitter which helps to regulate appetite, sleep patterns and mood, and produces the all-important sleep-inducing chemical, melatonin.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another tried-and-tested way to tackle deep-rooted stress or anxiety which may be keeping you awake. Before he begins with any client, Lee Grant, CBT consultant (020 7929 7911), focuses on &#8216;sleep hygiene&#8217;, which is effectively a list of lifestyle dos and don&#8217;ts. &#8216;The most important of the dos is to only go to sleep when drowsy and wake up at the same time each morning, including weekends,&#8217; explains Lee. &#8216;This will give you a consistent sleep rhythm and synchronise your biological clock.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Daytime naps, however tempting, should be avoided, adds Kevin. &#8216;If you&#8217;ve got a sleep problem, sleepiness should be seen as a resource, not something to be squandered during the day, but saved up for night time.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Other rules are taking regular exercise (but not after 6pm as this will keep the adrenalin pumping), avoiding alcohol and stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine a few hours before bedtime and trying to make your sleeping environment cosy with minimum sound, light and noise and a comfortable temperature. Once good sleep hygiene is in place, CBT focuses on techniques to stem midnight panics about not having filled in your tax return. &#8216;We&#8217;ll teach you ways to relax and postpone your worry or schedule worry time so you don&#8217;t end up doing it all night,&#8217; says Lee.</p>\n<p>With courses short and sleep often improving after just six sessions, Kevin believes CBT offers a much better alternative to sleeping pills. &#8216;Tablets might work to treat acute insomnia in the short term but they don&#8217;t address the causes of sleeplessness the way therapy does or give you tools in which to change your sleeping habits,&#8217; he says. Speak to your GP and you may qualify for a short course on the NHS or, if you go private, he should be able to give you a list of local recommended therapists. Sessions cost from &#163;40 to &#163;100 an hour.</p>\n<p>As well as an being an ageing population, we are also becoming increasingly overweight, and size can also be an issue when it comes to sleep problems. There has been a 25 per cent increase in sleep disorder patients in Scotland, with 80 per cent of them overweight. In most of these cases, patients have obstructive sleep apnoea caused by their windpipe getting floppier with fat, leading to choking during her sleep in the night when muscle relaxation is most profound. &#8216;This can happen 20 or 30 times in the night but because you don&#8217;t fully wake up, you might not even know you have it,&#8217; explains Morgan.</p>\n<p>Signs that you do have sleep apnoea include loud, heavy snoring (if you don&#8217;t know, your partner will tell you!), daytime exhaustion due to lack of deep sleep and morning headaches. Treatments vary from the self-help kind, such as sleeping on tennis balls (which are uncomfortable if you lie on your back and will encourage you to turn on your side) to throat- strengthening exercises, to getting special apparatus from a sleep clinic that can help with your breathing.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"diet-wellbeing/health-tired-all-the-time/gallery\">Discover why you're feeling so tired</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-insomnia-better-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep well - our complete guide</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-03T15:01:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"9","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"43.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7505054","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/diet-wellbeing/health-healthy-eating-naturally-good-sleep/v1","print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-08-07T15:06:00.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/menopause-help-sleep-problems","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"How much chocolate for 100 calories?","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"diet tips, 100 calories chocolate, chocolate, healthy eating, prima, calories","rate":"4.50","promo_title":"How to enjoy chocolate healthily","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-21T10:51:30.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"638","teaser":"How much chocolate for 100 calories?","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Can chocolate really do you good?

Indeed, last summer University of Cambridge scientists found chocolate lovers were 37 per cent less likely to suffer with cardiovascular disease and 29 per cent less likely to have a stroke, compared with those who ate little.</p>\n<p>It&#146;s just one of many studies to show a health benefit, with Harvard University publishing research revealing that cocoa and cocoa products lowered &#145;bad&#146; or LDL cholesterol, increased &#145;good&#146; or HDL cholesterol, reduced blood pressure and improved sensitivity to insulin, which helps to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. These health benefits are probably due to flavonoids in cocoa, which act as powerful antioxidants, similar to those found in tea and red wine. The high fat content of chocolate doesn&#146;t seem to offset the impact of these healthy flavonoids, either. Around a third of the fat is oleic acid, a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat typically found in olive oil. And while the remaining fat is saturated, one of the main saturates &#150; stearic acid &#150; doesn&#146;t appear to raise LDL cholesterol.</p>\n<p>It&#146;s not just our heart that benefits. In a German study, women who consumed a cocoa drink every day for 12 weeks noticed their skin was smoother and better hydrated, and tests showed it was less susceptible to ultra-violet damage.</p>\n<p>Chocolate is also thought to increase neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, which helps regulate mood and sleep. Indeed, researchers from University of Hull have found that 45g of dark chocolate each day (one small bar) for two months eased chronic fatigue syndrome. To maximise the benefits, opt for chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa solids, such as Green & Black&#146;s 85% Dark Chocolate (&#163;2.06 per 100g bar, available nationwide).</p>\n<p>But there&#146;s no getting away from it &#150; chocolate is high in calories, fat and sugar. As a result, experts agree you should enjoy it in moderation, for example, around 100 calories worth.</p>\n<h3>What is 100 calories...?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>One third of a Snickers</li>\n<li>Ten Maltesers</li>\n<li>One Cadbury Caramel Bunny</li>\n<li>Three After Eights</li>\n<li>Two thirds of a Flake</li>\n<li>Eight Minstrels</li>\n<li>Two thirds of a Twix biscuit</li>\n<li>One Fudge bar</li>\n<li>Half a Crunchie</li>\n<li>Two segments of Chocolate Orange</li>\n<li>Two-finger Kit Kat</li>\n<li>Three quarters of one Bounty piece</li>\n<li>One and a third Ferrero Rocher</li>\n<li>20g Easter egg shell</li>\n<li>11 Chocolate M&Ms</li>\n<li>Two fifths of a Mars Bar</li>\n<li>Three triangles of Toblerone</li>\n<li>Seven Mini Eggs</li>\n<li>Four pieces of Green & Black&#146;s 85% Dark Chocolate</li>\n<li>18 Smarties</li>\n<li>Two wrapped chocolates, eg Celebrations</li>\n<li>20 Chocolate Buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/healthy-eating/why-chocolate-is-good-for-you-37021\" target=\"_blank\">Why chocolate is good for you</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/diet/the-red-wine-chocolate-diet-42558\" target=\"_blank\">The red wine and chocolate diet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/diet/clever-ways-to-save-100-calories-53467\" target=\"_blank\">50+ clever ways to save 100 calories</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-03T13:19:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"2","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"9.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7358724","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-26T09:50:28.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-03-15T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/healthy-eating/chocolate-calories-calories-in-chocolate","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The famed director gives an exclusive glimpse of what lies behind the silver screen.","site_id":"17","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.harpersbazaar.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"may 2012, james cameron","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"The World of James Cameron","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-02T21:40:08.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/beauty/todays-beauty-secret","link_text":"Today's Beauty Secret"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/james-cameron-fashion-shoot-0512","link_text":"The World of James Cameron"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/james-cameron-behind-the-scenes","link_text":"On Set of the James Cameron Shoot"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/fashion-articles/cameron-diaz-pictures-0810","link_text":"Cameron Diaz: The Cover Shoot"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/best-dressed-celebrities-050412","link_text":"Mr. Blasberg's Best-Dressed List: May 4th, 2012"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/fashion-articles/mr-blasbergs-best-dressed-harpers-bazaar","link_text":"Mr. Blasberg's Best-Dressed List"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/magazine/cameron-diaz-interview-0810","link_text":"Cameron Diaz: Woman on Top"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/magazine/cover/cameron-kate-style-0107","link_text":"Cameron's &amp;

But, before you wipe your cabinet shelves clean to make way for warm-weather-appropriate products, give these transitional beauty goods a second chance.</p>\n\n<p>Despite my wavy-straight hair, I fight frizz all-year-round. While many anti-frizz products are only available in hot-weather-friendly cream or serum formulas, <a href=\"http://www.couturecolour.com/shop/couture-colour/pequi-oil-treatment-4oz/\" target=\"_blank\">Couture Color's Pequi Oil Treatment</a> ($32) works no matter the forecast. Rich in moisture-restoring antioxidants, vitamins A and E, proteins and lipids, this weightless treatment improves shine, texture, and any breakage or hair damage.</p>\n\n<p>I love a faux glow any day of the year. What I hate &#151; an unnatural, orange tint covering my body once bathing-suit-season rolls around. <a href=\"http://www.whishbody.com/products-self-tanner.php\" target=\"_blank\">Whish Coconut Milk SPF15 Self Tanner</a> ($34) provides believable bronzy color without streakage, even in the sunless winter months. The added octinoxate and oxybenzone are what carry this self-tanner from winter straight into my beach bag.</p>\n\n<p>I've written about my problematic skin before. Combating oil <i>and</i> dryness at the same time is no easy feat. Throw in a weather change, and my skin cries out for help of all kinds. I turn to <a href=\"http://www.advancedhomeactives.com/brazilian-peel-clear.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brazilian Peel Clear</a> ($45) to help fight breakouts without causing major alligator skin. Formulated with salicylic acid to treat acne and glycolic acid to neutralize and prevent future breakouts, this kit is perfectly effective yet gentle enough for my combination skin.</p>\n\n<p>While my shadows, liners, and foundations change with each season, the one product that remains the same (and is a staple in my daily routine) is bronzer. During the summer months, bronzers deliver sun-kissed color flawlessly, but in the winter, golden skin can look dirty and artificial. That's why I love <a href=\"https://www.toofaced.com/p-1019-beach-bunny-bronzer.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Too Faced Beach Bunny Bronzer</a> ($29). The illuminating powder combines four universally flattering shades to create a believable shimmer in December and a deep tan come July.</p>\n\n<p><i>Lindsay Leff is a beauty industry veteran who created <a href=\"http://www.kissandwear.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kiss and Wear</a> to showcase her favorite products, dissect celebrity beauty looks, and teach others how to live with style.</i></p>\n"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-04-02T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"Leff","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7675255","related_links":"<a href=\"/hair-beauty/how-to/best-beauty-products-tested-beauty\">30 Best Beauty Products of the Year</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/change-beauty-products\">17 Beauty Products That Changed Our Lives</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/summer-beauty-products-0808\">4 Hot Beauty Products for Summer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/2012-beauty-awards\">The 2012 Prix d'Excellence Beauty Awards</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/favorite-beauty-product\">What's Your Favorite Beauty Product?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/beauty-glossary\">The Beauty Glossary</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/celebrity-tips/carrie-underwood-beauty-secrets\">Carrie Underwood's Rocky Beauty Past</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/best-beauty-products-0309\">This Month's Best Beauty Buys</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/celebrity-tips/arielle-dombasle\">What's In Arielle Dombasle's Makeup Bag?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/celebrity-tips/marie-villepin\">What's In Marie Villepin's Makeup Bag?</a><br>\n","suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T17:28:54.000Z","author_id":"37755","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"marieclaire","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Marie Claire","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"canonical_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/style-blog/year-round-beauty-products","issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Reduce your motoring costs","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"import_modified_by":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"cut motoring costs, motoring costs, save money, cut driving costs","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Drive better - and save &#163;300 a year","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-26T15:49:00.000Z","headline_image_url":null,"related_links_list":[],"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"641","teaser":"Reduce your motoring costs","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Everyone is feeling the pain of filling up at the pumps - but simply driving carefully and gently can reduce your bills easily...

If you drive a larger vehicle, you&#8217;ll spend a lot more. Here&#8217;s how to make your money go that extra mile&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Start here</h3>\n<p>Check your current fuel consumption so you can quantify your savings later. If your car has an onboard computer this is easy to do, but if not, look up your car on <a href=\"http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\">http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk</a> to see fuel consumption details.</p>\n<h3>Under pressure</h3>\n<p>Check your tyre pressures are correct and save up to 3% on your fuel consumption &#8211; that&#8217;s &#163;46 a year (1). The figures should be in your car handbook, or type in your registration number at <a href=\"http://www.tyresafe.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.tyresafe.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plan your journey</h3>\n<p>Driving extra miles because you&#8217;re lost can be expensive! So if you often drive unfamiliar routes, a satnav may be a good idea. If you have an iPhone 4, download the free satnav <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/navfree-gps-live-uk-roi/id391334793?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Navfree </a>at the App Store, or use the <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/aa-parking/id365260102?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">AA Parking</a> app to find the cheapest parking near you (for iPhone and Android, &#163;1.99).</p>\n<h3>It ain&#8217;t heavy</h3>\n<p>From golf clubs to an unused roof rack, extra weight means higher fuel costs. Travelling light can mean savings of 2% according to the RAC &#8211; &#163;31 a year.</p>\n<h3>Switch off</h3>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ll be stuck in a queue for more than a minute, turn off your engine to save fuel. And switch off demisters, headlights and the heated rear windscreen when not in use.</p>\n<h3>Take a chill pill</h3>\n<p>Driving at 80mph uses up to 25% more fuel than driving at 70mph, says Continental Tyres, and the most economical driving speed is 50 to 55mph.</p>\n<h3>Staying cool</h3>\n<p>Using air-con the right way can cut costs by 5% or &#163;77 a year (1). Leave windows open when driving around town, but on the motorway use the air-con, as lowered windows mean more drag and greater fuel consumption.</p>\n<h3>Eco-driving</h3>\n<p>Aim for a smooth driving style, avoiding harsh acceleration and braking. Also, use higher gears for better fuel economy. Ecodriving can provide savings of at least &#163;155.</p>\n<h3>Teen driver?</h3>\n<p>One way of reducing insurance costs for young people is using new technology, such as The Co-operative Insurance&#8217;s Young Driver scheme. A &#8216;smartbox&#8217; GPS device is fitted in the car to measure driver behaviour, which, if good, is then rewarded with discounts on premiums (<a href=\"http://www.co-operativeinsurance.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.co-operativeinsurance.co.uk</a>).</p>\n<p><em>&#163;300 saving based on Continental Tyres survey, 2011. *RAC Cost of Motoring survey 2011.

Since 1996, the cesarean rate has soared a whopping 56 percent. Doctors order them when they're needed, but 2.5 percent happen at the&#160;<em>mom's</em>&#160;request. What many women don't realize is that a C-section is a major surgery, and with that comes the risk of infections, anesthesia complications, blood clots, and worse. There may also be problems with future pregnancies. These risks are small, but why take them? I can tell you as a mom of four that motherhood will be filled with lots of naturally occurring inconveniences--not only the due date.
