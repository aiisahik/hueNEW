While some behaviors, like cheating, are obvious deal-breakers, other seeming threats can actually have a positive impact on your relationship. Below, nine marital mannerisms that may seem ominous but truly can be good, according to experts. Plus, what to watch out for so things don&#146;t go too far.</p>\n<p><strong>1. You both fantasize about other people.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Fantasies are an ancient aphrodisiac,&#148; says <a href=\"http://www.iriskrasnow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Iris Krasnow</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Lives-Wives-Married/dp/1592406807\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Secret Lives of Wives: Women Share What It Really Takes to Stay Married</em></a>. &#147;A vivid imagination allows you to open up to your partner physically and emotionally.\" So thinking about a sexy neighbor, for example, can improve your marriage&#151;as long as those racy visions stay in your mind. That means leave it out of pillow talk; neither of you needs to know exactly who&#151;or what&#151;the other is thinking about. And don&#146;t let daydreams jeopardize the intimacy you feel with your spouse, says Krasnow. &#147;The danger is when fantasy becomes an obsession that overshadows a real relationship.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>2. He goes out with the guys.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Happily married couples have an active life together and dynamic life apart,&#148; says <a href=\"http://www.andreasyrtash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Syrtash</a>, relationship expert and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cheat-On-Your-Husband-Spouse/dp/1609611098\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cheat on Your Husband (with Your Husband)</em></a><em>.</em> &#147;Interests and hobbies outside of marriage feed a person&#146;s spirit and help break up routine.&#148; Cathy* of Chicago, IL, knows this firsthand from her part-time musician husband. &#147;He goes to band &#145;practice,&#146; and I put that in quotes because sometimes it&#146;s just an excuse to drink beers with the boys.&#148; Cathy used to be bothered by it but not anymore. &#147;He always comes home by midnight and answers any questions I have,&#148; she says, adding that he&#146;s happier and more relaxed the next day. But the real coup: &#147;When I want to do things with my friends&#151;especially now that we have a baby&#151;he&#146;ll move mountains for me to be able to do that,&#148; she says.</p>\n<p><strong>3. You argue a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>Fighting isn&#146;t necessarily a sign of a broken relationship, says Syrtash. &#147;It means you trust each other enough to share your feelings,&#148; she says. The key is arguing without attacking your spouse&#146;s character. And when you hear him out out and solve misunderstandings, you're strengthening your bond. Even recurring fights aren&#146;t cause for concern. \"Couples tend to recycle arguments,&#148; says Syrtash. &#147;Identify what you keep arguing about when you're not in the heart of a fight.&#160;Try, &#145;I know you don't like the way I clean the kitchen, but it looks clean to me when I'm done. How can I make you feel better about it?&#146; Listen, and then mention what triggers you and why it's important to you.&#148; One caveat: If you're constantly arguing about things that you can&#146;t change about each other, like personality traits, you have to decide whether or not you can live with them.</p>\n<p><strong>4. He spends a lot of money on his hobbies.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;It&#146;s one thing to go to Vegas when you can&#146;t make mortgage payments,&#148; says Krasnow. &#147;But if the bills are paid and the kids are taken care of, let your husband get new golf clubs or go on a fishing trip.&#148; Couples need to feel like they&#146;re growing as individuals, and occasional splurges can enhance personal fulfillment. &#147;When two people are happy separately, they have a better shot of going the distance together,&#148; says Krasnow.</p>\n<p><strong>5. He uses porn.</strong>&#8232;</p>\n<p>Porn is a slippery slope, but it doesn&#146;t have to mean disaster, says <a href=\"http://www.therapyhelp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Heitler</a>, PhD, a Denver psychologist and creator of the marriage-skills website <a href=\"http://poweroftwomarriage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PowerofTwoMarriage.com</a>. Couples who are honest about their interest in porn may be able to incorporate it into their sex lives. &#147;Consider using it as a lead-up to the act or to enhance your routine,&#148; says Dr. Heitler. It only becomes problematic when porn is used in secret or instead of interaction with a partner. But if he or you use it occasionally when the other&#146;s not around, that&#146;s okay.</p>\n<p><strong>6. He works all the time.</strong></p>\n<p>Melissa* from Ft. Lauderdale, FL, was frustrated by her husband&#146;s 60-hour workweek. &#147;I felt like a single mom to our two boys,&#148; she says. Eventually, though, she realized that even after-work functions were his way of climbing the corporate ladder. &#147;He had to schmooze to market himself. It was his way of showing the company he was willing to do whatever necessary,&#148; she points out. He was ultimately made manager, and Melissa says the benefits aren&#146;t merely financial: &#147;Because he misses the kids&#146; activities during the week, he devotes entire weekends to building our family bond.&#148; If your man is a workhorse, think back to when you first started dating, suggests Syrtash. Chances are, his drive and passion for his job are qualities that initially attracted you to him. But it could be a problem if &#147;work always comes first&#151;ahead of your kid&#146;s school play or your anniversary,&#148; says Syrtash.</p>\n<p><strong>7. You both flirt with other people online.</strong></p>\n<p>Between Facebook, Twitter and more, it&#146;s easier than ever to reconnect with old flames, says Krasnow. But flirty friendships can be healthy as long as they don&#146;t get physical, she notes. &#147;It&#146;s a self-esteem boost when men you don&#146;t live with find you smart, inspiring and beautiful,&#148; she says. When women feel good, they make better moms and wives. But be careful: Virtual relationships lose their innocence when a married person becomes infatuated with someone else.<strong> </strong>And that obsession can cause someone to mislead their online love interest. \"Avoid giving off vibes like you might get a divorce,&#148; says Krasnow. &#147;Bashing your husband because you&#146;re having a bad day isn&#146;t okay. Sending provocative photos is also a bad idea.\"</p>\n<p><strong>8. You&#146;re too tired for sex.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;We&#146;re all overscheduled,\" says Syrtash. \"It&#146;s hard to find time for anything, let alone making love.\" But the less you do it, the less you&#146;ll want to do it: A lack of intercourse causes testosterone levels to drop in both sexes, says Syrtash. Instead of waiting for inspiration to strike, schedule sex. It gives you something to anticipate, explains Syrtash. And have fun with it! Designate Tuesday night as date night&#151;then, send playful texts during the day to fuel the fire.</p>\n<p><strong>9. He&#146;s close with a female colleague.</strong></p>\n<p>Acknowledge that your husband&#146;s success on the job may be a direct result of his ability to work well with others. In fact, &#147;your financial stability and social status may depend on this specific office relationship,&#148; says Dr. Heitler. While the potential exists for sexual feelings to arise when a man and woman work together, couples can beat the threat by talking openly about their fears. If your man is getting too chummy with his office wife, Dr. Heitler suggests asking him to keep conversations work-specific, stick to public places and avoid alcohol, which can lead to inappropriate behavior.</p>\n<p>*Names have been changed.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2013-01-08T14:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"996714","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/Xz/sad-woman-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Pfeffer","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mcepeda@hearst.com","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8901791","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-01-08T15:31:22.000Z","author_id":"50584","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-16T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/dating-marriage/marriage-problems-that-are-good-for-you","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"<p>Read <em>Seventeen</em> on your Nook, Kindle, iPad, or Android tablet.

Even if the clothing fit well when you tried it on, some surprising factors may have led to your shopping regret. Deliberating your purchase in the dressing room rather than rushing to the cash register will help you &#147;invest in long-lasting pieces that you&#146;ll pull out of your closet again and again,&#148; says Colin Megaro, a Los Angeles&#150;based celebrity stylist. What exactly should you consider? Do these eight things in the dressing room and you&#146;ll wind up with a wardrobe you love.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Read the care instructions.</strong></p>\n<p>Ask yourself: &#147;Does the garment require special care&#151;hand-wash or dry-clean only&#151;and am I willing to follow these instructions?&#148; advises Carol Davidson, founder of StyleWorks, an image consulting company in New York City.&#160;And don&#146;t forget to factor in the cost and hassle of dry-cleaning or hand-washing before you buy. Laundering a dry-clean-only shirt can cost $30 a year. If you still want it after considering that, it&#146;s a sure sign you should buy it.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Conduct a wrinkle test.</strong></p>\n<p>To make sure the fabric wears well all day long, Davidson suggests you &#147;scrunch it in your hand and hold for a few seconds. If it&#146;s wrinkle-free after releasing the fabric, it isn&#146;t likely to be wrinkled at the end of a day of wear,&#148; she says. If the item is wrinkled in your hand&#151;or on the hanger&#151;you may want to skip this purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Try it on as an outfit.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Some women will try on a fancy top with the jeans they wore running out the house. This makes it difficult to judge the true look of the item,&#148; says Dawn Del Russo, a fashion and lifestyle stylist in New York City. &#147;Instead, try on the piece with shoes and the appropriate bottoms or top,&#148; she recommends. If there&#146;s an item you&#146;re eyeing, take key pieces to the dressing room that complete the look, or ask a salesperson to assemble an outfit from other items in the store. Some dressing rooms already have heels on hand to help you evaluate dressier pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do a mental run-through of your closet.</strong></p>\n<p>Many of us stick to styles and colors we already own. Think about whether you&#146;d be doubling up if you bought the piece you&#146;re trying on. Also, make sure your upcoming purchase can be integrated into your existing wardrobe. &#147;New clothes should coordinate with and be mixed and matched with what you already own,&#148; says Melagro. Take a peek in your closet before you shop, so its contents are fresh in your mind.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Get a rear view.</strong></p>\n<p>No matter how you pose in front of the dressing-room mirror, it&#146;ll take extra effort to see your backside, says Stephanie Poli, a fashion blogger and TV editor. But it&#146;s worth it. Get an accurate glimpse in a three-way mirror whenever possible. Or take out your makeup compact, turn around with your back to the dressing-room mirror and use your little mirror to check your reflection. If you have time, get an even better grasp on all-around fit by trying on two sizes of the same item.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Seek out natural lighting and mirrors.</strong></p>\n<p>Dressing-room lighting can change how you think the clothes look on you. &#147;Super-bright lights can make you look washed-out,&#148; says Del Russo. &#147;But in too-dim lighting, you won&#146;t notice if a top is sheer.&#148; Tilted mirrors can also be misleading, elongating your figure and making you think the clothes are slimming. Find mirrors that are flat against the wall to get an accurate reflection. And beware of this sneaky store trick: Some disguise leaning mirrors with a thick frame, so they look like they&#146;re flush against the wall when they&#146;re actually tilted. In that case, step out of the dressing room for a fair assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Move around.</strong></p>\n<p>Simply posing in front of the dressing-room mirror isn&#146;t enough to get a feel for fit. Instead, &#147;sit, bend over and stand on your tip-toes if you&#146;re wearing flats,&#148; says Poli. &#147;Getting the full range of fit, length and comfort will alert you to certain surprise factors,&#148; like a button that digs into your stomach or a jacket that restricts your arms. Sitting in pants and skirts is especially crucial because something that fits you standing up can suddenly seem too tight when you&#146;re sitting down. And if you&#146;re wearing the item to a party, dancing in it is a good idea&#151;you may want to stay out of sight of fellow shoppers, though.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Check the details.</strong></p>\n<p>You may know to test zippers and check that all buttons are in place and there are no loose threads. But you should also see if there&#146;s enough additional fabric to make alterations. &#147;A few simple changes can make almost any piece of clothing look perfect for your body,&#148; says Megaro&#151;and add longevity to your purchase too. So turn the garment inside out and look for at least one centimeter of extra fabric at the seams.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-11-26T14:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"989661","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/sK/trying-on-red-dress-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Dizik","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mcepeda@hearst.com","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8738957","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-11-26T17:07:30.000Z","author_id":"37951","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-10T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/style-beauty/fashion-style/dressing-room-tips","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Looking for fresh beauty inspiration?

And though it&#146;s usually a staple shade for fall, celebs like Camilla Belle, Kate Bosworth, and Lana Del Ray showed it&#146;s just as wearable in the spring.</p>\n<p>\"This dark, sultry hue is the new statement lip color,\" says celebrity makeup artist, Erica Whelan. \"Especially at an event where people are going to take fashion risks, like the Met Gala, since a red lip might have come across as too retro-looking.\"</p><p>But that doesn't mean you can only rock this blackberry color if you're attending a star-studded event. Just going out with the girls? Whelan suggests keeping the rest of your makeup subdued, much like Camilla and Kate did. \"It's also important to wear the right shade for your skin tone,\" she says.</p>\n<p>If you're fair, go with a more pinkish-purple berry blend (Revlon Super Lustrous Creme Lipstick in Black Cherry, $9.94, <a title=\"revlon\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-Super-Lustrous-Lipstick-Cherry/dp/B001G7PJH0\" target=\"_blank\">amazon.com</a>); for medium skin tones, use a red-brick berry hue (L'Or&#233;al Paris Infallible Le Rouge in Java Jolt, $6.98, <a title=\"loreal\" href=\"http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/l'oreal-infallible-le-rouge-lip-colour/ID=prod6053758-product\" target=\"_blank\">walgreens.com</a>); darker complected women will look best in a dark burgundy option (Dior Addict Extreme Lipstick in Black Tie, $30,&#160;<a title=\"Dior\" href=\"http://www.dior.com/beauty/usa/en/makeup/lips/lipsticks/dior-addict/y0028623/py0028623-clipsticks.html\" target=\"_blank\">dior.com</a>). Just wanna take a baby step into this trend? A sheer version is the way to go. Try Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, $15, <a title=\"clinique\" href=\"http://www.clinique.com/product/1605/4772/Makeup/Lipsticks/index.tmpl?cm_mmc=GoogleProductSearch-_-Null-_-Null-_-Null\" target=\"_blank\">clinique.com</a>.</p><p>No matter what color you choose, just remember: the more matte the better, since adding a glossy finish to your entire mouth can be overkill&#151;and could cause your lipstick to bleed. If you want to add a little shine, dab some clear gloss to <em>just</em> the center of your pout.&#160;</p>\n<p>So what do you think, will you be swiping on this daring color soon?</p>\n\n<p>Photo

is between 10.30am and 11.30am.</p>\n<p>Overweight subjects in a new study published in the <em>Journal of the American Dietetic Association</em> lost significantly less weight when they snacked at

target=\"_blank\">Sensible snacking</a> is an effective tool for boosting weight loss as it keeps your metabolism ticking over, but researchers believe that if you do it in the morning, the short space of time between your &#145;elevenses&#146; and lunch sets up an expectation of eating at the same intervals through the rest of the day, so more calories are consumed in total.</p>\n<p>They also discovered that subjects were less likely to snack on healthy items such as fruit at this time of day. The reason is unclear &#150; although the stacks of pastries at most coffee shops may well have something to do with it.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Photography: Sam

You're crossing the finishing line. We're mixing the drinks. What'll it be?</h2>\n<p>A Beer\n<br />B Champagne\n<br />C Cocktail\n<br />D Water\n<br /><strong>Answer</strong> I&#146;ll go for a cocktail &#150; a gin and tonic. But I&#146;ll only have one, so it&#146;d better be good. There are three elements to race preparation: training, diet and recovery. And alcohol doesn&#146;t sit well with any of those.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Do you have any superstitions?</h2>\n<p>I hate flying and wear a cross when I board now. I was flying to Sa&#771;o Paulo two years ago when the tail hit the runway on landing, so my palms get sweaty whenever a plane descends. My New Year&#146;s resolution was to get over it by gaining my pilot&#146;s licence. I&#146;m getting there.</p>\n\n<h2>3. What's the secret to happiness?</h2>\n<p>Maintaining physical health, but also having a sense of purpose. Everybody needs a certain amount of fun in their life, but to be truly happy you need to make time for those around you, too.</p>\n\n<h2>4. What makes a winner?</h2>\n<p>A Training\n<br />B Diet\n<br />C Consistency\n<br />D Mindset\n<br /><strong>Answer</strong> Anyone can train hard for a short period. Winners give their best every hour of every day for months on end. My parents taught me if you start something, finish it. Between those two points, never give less than 100%.</p>\n\n<h2>5. What is your greatest ambition?</h2>\n<p>I want to improve education and awareness about disability. People focus on the disability and not on that person&#146;s ability. We all have disabilities of some kind. There are few people with 100% ability.</p>\n\n<h2>6. If you could watch one film on your next flight, which would it be?</h2>\n<p>A Blade Runner\n<br />B Invictus\n<br />C Chariots of Fire\n<br />D Marathon Man\n<br /><strong>Answer</strong> No question here: <em>Chariots of Fire</em> is an iconic film. It is incredibly inspirational.</p>\n\n<h2>7. When and where are you happiest?</h2>\n<p>At my home in Pretoria; when I&#146;m there I don&#146;t have to take another shirt out of another bag, shave or wait for a driver. It&#146;s the small things that really count.</p>\n\n<h2>8. What is your most valued possession?</h2>\n<p>A Pet tiger\n<br />B Medals\n<br />C Art\n<br />D Blades\n<br /><strong>Answer</strong> Sadly, I had to sell my tigers, but I&#146;m on the lookout for a king cheetah! Of my current possessions, I love art. In particular, some drawings by South African artist Pierneef &#150; they mean a lot to me.</p>\n\n<h2>9. What inspires you in darker moments?</h2>\n<p>Family. I couldn&#146;t live without them. Money, medals and records can all be made, lost and made again, but your family is irreplaceable. Life isn&#146;t about possessions or achievements. It&#146;s about people.</p>\n\n<h2>10. What is your greatest fear?</h2>\n<p>A Death\n<br />B Injury\n<br />C Failure\n<br />D Flying\n<br /><strong>Answer</strong> I&#146;m dealing with the flying situation, so my greatest fear is unfulfilled potential. I can&#146;t bear the idea of looking back and thinking I could have done better.</p>\n\n<h2>The <em>MH</em> diagnosis </h2>\n<p><em>Psychologist Sophie Stone shrinks the answers</em>\n<br />Oscar has a pragmatic, analytical approach to problem solving. Actions are both the basis for measuring his own success and his impression of others. Encouraged from an early age to be a high achiever, he will not give up, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. In tough situations, his analytical thinking style helps to provide practical solutions and enables him to remain focused.</p>\n\n<p>You can improve your power of self-analysis by using Cognitive Analytical therapy (CAT), which enables you to reflect on learnt attitudes about yourself. Look at a problem from different angles &#150; if moving house appears difficult, look at the facts, then examine your emotional response. Reflect objectively then explore solutions (as Oscar has done with learning to fly). Issues that seemed huge can be easily overcome.</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-08-09T06:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8892638","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/living/oscar-pistorius\">MH Interview : Oscar Pistorius </a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/christian-malcom-olympic-training-regime\">The sprinter : Christian Malcolm</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/mh-interview-harry-aikines-aryeetey-556849\">MH interview : Harry Aikines-Aryeetey</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/in-the-hot-seat-286623\">Improve your interview skills</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/mh-interview-ricky-gervais\">MH interview : Ricky Gervais</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/interview-lee-riley\">MH interview : Lee Riley</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/mh-interview-darren-bent-544571\">MH interview : Darren Bent</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/imhi-interview-sir-chris-hoy-462935\">MH interview : Sir Chris Hoy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/mh-interview-danny-macaskill\">MH interview : Danny MacAskill</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/interview-ryan-bingham\">MH interview : Ryan Bingham</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"jun '12 p51","print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-01-29T12:04:01.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-16T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/living/men/oscar-pistorius","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"According to the guys at ModernMan.com, there are puh-lenty of things we do that dudes just don't get.

(<a href=\"http://pinterest.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest.com</a> is a social media website that lets you build virtual collages from beautiful images you digitally \"pin\" on your own boards.)</p>\n<p>\"I don't even know what I'd put down for hobbies anymore,\" I said, not meaning it to sound as plaintive as it did.</p>\n<p>\"Well, of course,\" she said, making a sweeping gesture that I understood to take in my kids, even though they weren't with us. \"Because you have five of them now.\"</p>\n<p>I went away thinking about the things I used to enjoy that, once our youngest was born and time was more limited, hadn't made the cut. What would I put on the boards?</p>\n<p>It became a statement of values, a mental shorthand for something philosophically larger: <em>What makes the board.</em></p>\n<p>I decided to use Pinterest as an exercise in soul-searching. I went to the site and created three boards: <b>Have Been</b>, <b>Am</b>, and <b>Becoming</b>. And I posted (or \"pinned\") images that reflected each phase of my life.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/nicholebernier/have-been/\" target=\"_blank\">Have Been</a>, there was skydiving, writing, running, golfing, skiing, horseback riding, traveling. Gourmet meals. Gorgeous handmade cable-knit sweaters. Glamorous stiletto sandals.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/nicholebernier/am/\" target=\"_blank\">Am</a>, there was yoga, writing, baking cookies, looking after a kitten litter, patent leather Dansko clogs, and the Von Trapps &#151; well, minus the singing, the wealth, and the nanny.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/nicholebernier/becoming/\" target=\"_blank\">Becoming</a>, I imagined &#151; yes &#151; golf, and more yoga, writing, and travel. I want to take inn-to-inn trips abroad, by bike or horseback. Also there is the dream of someday working for Smile Train, an international organization aiding children with cleft palates. And baby alpacas: I want to have a small farm and breed alpacas. But the centerpiece is an arresting portrait of a gorgeous old woman: She wears an evening gown, smiling happily with her eyes closed and her elegant arms outstretched like she is embracing the all of herself.</p>\n<p>I made my boards, like planting a flag on the moon. And I learned something: I may well have winnowed my life down to just a few things right now, but there are still shadows of all that has been the essence of me.</p>\n<p>And if I'm fortunate enough to live to be 80, I hope to sit at peace with my arms open wide, grateful that the best of my energy and intentions lasted to make it to the Becoming, and bring them all into my bony embrace.</p>\n<p><em>Nichole Bernier lives near Boston with her family.

Eight feet below, swamp water sloshes in front of our 4-foot-high tractor tires, rousing an alligator that wriggles away for cover.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nI ease the accelerator forward and begin to move, feeling my way across the submerged potholes. It's like riding a swaying, noisy metal elephant. There are reasons to take things slowly&#151;vehicles have vanished into the sucking mud of the Everglades. \"It's an extreme environment,\" says Gene Van Schaick, 70, the builder and owner of the behemoth I'm piloting. \"It'll kick your ass.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nI've met up with Van Schaick to experience the landscape he loves best&#151;the wetlands of southern Florida&#151;aboard the machine he's most passionate about: the swamp buggy. Most Americans tend to associate \"swamp\" with words such as \"stagnant\" and \"malaria\" and think of swamp buggies as dirt-flinging hot rods that race up and down mud wallows. But Van Schaick's swamp buggies are slow, utilitarian vehicles, and as for the swamp&#151;well... \"I don't know what people think of when they trash-talk swamps,\" he says. \"I love the swamp. I love the views. I love the smell.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOne point he'll concede: The swamp is hard to navigate. In recent geological time the area was limestone and coral reef, and it's still so flat that the torrential rains of summer and fall are slow to drain. For all but a brief dry season, waterlogged marshes and open water predominate. Anyone trying to hike in has to contend not only with the sheer physical exertion but dense vegetation, hungry alligators, clouds of mosquitoes, and four kinds of poisonous snakes.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nFor all its rigors, the backcountry has much to offer in the way of recreation; though an easy drive from Miami, it's full of game to hunt, as well as exotic specimens to lure the bird-watcher and flora enthusiast. To tap those opportunities, intrepid Floridians began a century ago to retrofit Model A and T Fords with big wheels and extra-low gearing. Today, a small but passionate subculture of builders&#151;including a group founded by Van Schaick in 1990&#151;carries on that legacy. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn a warm day in early February, Van Schaick takes me to a lot at the edge of an airstrip halfway between Miami and Naples, Fla. Some two dozen beefy, hard-driven machines are lined up, each one unique, having been designed and cobbled together&#151;mostly out of plate metal and parts of other vehicles&#151;by one of the 65 members of his club. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nVan Schaick, a retired carpenter, spent six years building his behemoth, Gray Ghost. The Goodyear tires yield 27 inches of clearance. The solid-steel tie rods are behind the axle for protection against cypress knees, the club-like growths that sprout from the roots of cypress trees. (If the knee hits the axle first, it won't be able to take out the tie rods.) The engine is a 2.8-liter V-6 from a 1982 Chevy Citation, without the fuel-injection system&#151;Van Schaick stripped it out and replaced it with a carburetor. \"Everything needs to be rugged and simple,\" he says, \"so you can fix it while standing in 3 feet of water.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nVan Schaick and I clamber on top of the buggy, which, from up here, looks like a boat&#151;fitting for a vehicle that can negotiate 6 feet of water. I fire up the engine and we head out. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nPast the parking lot are 38 square miles of county-owned land. Though the landscape is nearly identical to the federally administered Big Cypress National Preserve next door, there are fewer restrictions on its use. Soon we're axle-deep in muddy water, moving across the cypress prairie. The landscape looks like something out of Dr. Seuss, an expanse of twisted gray trunks garlanded with bushy bromeliads bearing spiky red flowers. Farther on, the road becomes hemmed in by a forest so dense it feels like we're driving through a tunnel. Our wheels churn up mud the consistency of brownie batter. We never move faster than walking pace, and after an hour and a half we've covered only 5 miles. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nVan Schaick takes the wheel and gives me a tour, from the high ridges and island-like hardwood hammocks that remain partially dry year-round to the sediment-filled saw-grass ponds that during the wettest months become, as he puts it, \"bottomless.\" Van Schaick has seen lots of things in these wetlands over the years. Once he surprised a panther while on foot. \"It was less than 10 yards from me,\" he says. \"It went straight up, turned in the air, and headed the other way.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nI'm surprised at how pleasant it is. There's no oppressive stench; the water in the Everglades isn't stagnant but part of a broad, slow-moving flow. Snakes and alligators thrive here; so do deer, wild hogs, and turkeys. Without buggies, much of this verdant wilderness would be all but inaccessible. \"It's uncomfortable for hiking, and it's easy to get turned around,\" Van Schaick says. \"Anyone who doesn't know the area well isn't going to be able to penetrate the interior.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNevertheless, the machines have their detractors. \"They are detrimental to the environment,\" says Matthew Schwartz, executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association. \"The ground is very fragile, and when you put that much weight on it, the soil doesn't recover. It erodes right down to the limestone.\" Schwartz's group wants to keep motorized recreation from expanding within Big Cypress. But Van Schaick counters that most of the soil eroded by swamp buggies is replenished during each yearly cycle of flooding. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs we stop at a saw-grass pond and kill the engine, we can imagine that except for the machine under our butts, there is no sign of civilization. We could be in some remote wilderness, not an hour from one of the East Coast's biggest cities. A breeze moves across the tall green stalks of the saw grass, bearing a sweetly resinous tang.

For grease monkeys the world over, air tools elicit envy&#151;and for good reason. Their speed and power make car work dramatically easier and put more projects within reach. With a properly sized shop air system, cutting, grinding, polishing, painting, sanding, inflating, and even cleaning up take less time and sweat. Assembling a system for yourself can be a little daunting because there's no shortage of lingo and fiddly components. We've put together a guide to the basics, along with a roundup of the tools we have in our own garage. Be warned, air tools can spoil you.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Air Compressor</strong></h3><br />\n\nCompressors are sized by SCFM&#151;standard cubic feet per minute&#151;the measure of how much air the machine can deliver when running constantly. An air compressor's SCFM sets the minimum performance of the system hooked up to it, so look to the consumption rate of the tools you use to decide how to size the compressor. There are two types: Single-stage units are smaller and louder, cycle more often, and are less expensive. Two-stage compressors are quieter, cycle less frequently, and deliver lots of continuous pressure. Pressure tank size is another variable. Bigger tanks hold more air, so the compressor won't kick on as often, but small tanks are portable. For more capacity, connect additional tanks by plugging into a quick-disconnect coupling with a rubber hose.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Pipes, Hoses, and Fittings</strong></h3><br />\n\nDesign your system of air lines based on budget, garage size, and how often you use your tools. Flexible 3/8-inch rubber air hose is inexpensive and easy to store for the small shop and occasional use. With a bigger garage, consider permanently installed rigid air lines. Options range from simple iron pipe threaded together and sealed, to a slick system from Rapid-Air. The company's modular wall-mounted high-volume hard-pipe or semirigid in-wall kits are assembled by using just a pipe cutter and reamer; if you want, the two systems can be used together.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWith all setups, hoses and tools connect via a quick-disconnect coupling. This standardized fitting is threaded onto a hose or pipe end and positively connects the female end on the tool to the male end on the supply side. Be sure to use thread seal tape or plumber's dope for airtight joints.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>The End of the Line</strong></h3><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/8Z/air-tools-02-0712-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe price of air tools varies wildly.

Amplifier</strong></span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>1.  </b>Place the amplifier on a work surface, flat side down; position the amp so that the row of four small holes is on the top edge. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>2.   </b>Strip &#188; inch of the ends of the two battery-clip wires; slip the tips of the wires through two of the four holes closer to the amp<i>'</i>s right corner, with the black wire in the outermost hole. Bend and then solder the tips to the flat side of the amp. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>3.  </b>Pair two sets of the red-and-black wires included with the speakers; cut into 15-inch lengths. Strip &#194;&#173;&#188; inch of each wire tip, then loop each pair once around the rim of a ferrite donut.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>4.  </b>Wrap a tip of one red and one black wire around the legs of a capacitor. Slip one leg through each of the holes next to those where the battery-clip wires are soldered. The wire colors must alternate: black, red, black, red. Solder the capacitor legs and wires to the amp. (This pair of wires feeds one of the speakers.)\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>5.  </b>Locate the two holes, about &#189; inch from the right side of the amp. Repeat Step 4, slipping the tip of a length of black wire through the hole marked with a minus (negative) sign, and a red wire tip through the other hole marked with a plus (positive) sign. Solder in place. (This pair of wires feeds the other speaker.)\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/0Z/bbot-box-boombox-0712-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Attach the Components Inside the Box</strong></span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>6.  </b>Apply glue to the flat side of the amp assembly, and stick it to the inside of one of the two larger faces of the boot box. Position the amp so that the switch-ribbon cable reaches the point on the side of the box where you will install the volume-control knob (step 9).\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>7.  </b>Using the self-adhesive tape on each exciter (speaker), affix them to the same face of the box as the amp. Clip the speakers to the two sets of wires attached to the capacitors. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>8.  </b>Glue the battery pack near a lower corner inside the box. Attach the battery pack to the amp using the clip.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>9.  </b>Remove the knob from the volume control (this is also the on/off switch). Poke a hole through a side of the box large enough to fit the stem of the volume control. Place the stem through the hole, reattach the knob, and glue the assembly to the inside of the box.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>10.  </b>Plug one end of the switch ribbon into the amp and the other end into the volume-control unit. Glue down the ribbon.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>11.  </b>Plug the ends of the speaker cable into the amp and the device that holds your music library.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Attach Your Device</strong></span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>12.  </b>Turn on your device with the volume on high, choose your favorite playlist, and press play. Close the box--and rock on!\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Optional Steps</strong></span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAdd a handle made of duct tape; punch a hole in the box through which you can feed a switching power supply wire to the amp.\n\n<br /><br

fretted for 30 years about all that could go wrong with my children. Now, I'm dropping my worry and picking up my new granddaughter instead.</p>\n<p>When, at two in the morning, after about five hours of active labor, the nurse said that my daughter Stoli was ready to push, I was so relieved I burst into a big smile. Before that, as my son-in-law Nels put it, I had been \"kind of worried.\" I'm willing to admit that was an understatement.</p>\n<p>This is their first child. They do not know how much can go wrong. Nels hadn't even noticed the alarming diagrams on the wall above the fetal heart monitor, but I couldn't help but read the instructions for resuscitating an unresponsive infant.</p>\n<p>Before I could dwell much on that possibility, Nels pressed Stoli's back, I held her hand and she groaned deeply, straining with her whole body. Suddenly, the baby was on her belly instead of in it&#8212;a bluish-wrinkled-old-woman-alien, all smeared with the white grease of the womb. Stoli was tearfully wide-eyed. Nels beamed. I scanned the faces of the professionals in the room and they were all smiling, too. I was the only one, it seemed, who had been at all concerned.</p>\n<p>The fact is, I've been worrying for almost 30 years about my own children and I'm not about to quit on my grandchildren. It is my job.</p>\n<p>When the baby girl squawked, I let out a huge sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>In spite of my fears, all was very well. As the doctor attended to Stoli the nurse lifted the little baby they named Lani, who grew prettier by the second, to the heat table. I was told to rub feet smaller than my thumbs.Her skin flushed pink from her dainty ankles to the scalp beneath her lovely black hair. Everything got blurry, but I quickly wiped my eyes. I needed to keep watch, so Lani wouldn't accidentally be switched with another newborn.</p>\n<p>Stoli never worries, which constantly amazes me. And worries me. Could it be that the upside to worrying all night about your children is that they, at least, sleep soundly?</p>\n<p>My daughter, my youngest of five children, lives in the moment, just as we all say we should, but most of us do not. When I asked her if she was concerned that the labor could stall and she'd have to have an emergency C-section, she said, simply, \"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't you read the labor and delivery section of <em>What to Expect When You're Expecting</em>?\" I had given her the book and had my own well-worn copy on the night table.</p>\n<p>\"It was too scary, so I kind of scanned it,\" she said. What? Is this my child?</p>\n<p>Stoli's pregnancy was as relatively easy for her as the birth. It was a tad more challenging for me. For starters, it was a surprise, and one that prompted her to decide not to finish her junior year of college. I had so wanted her to graduate. Secondly, she was single, and just 21. She has since married her boyfriend, with my blessing. But they are so young. Never mind that I was 22 when I got married. That was totally different.</p>\n<p>Because it was me.</p>\n<p>Later that morning, after we had all napped, I remembered the worried look on my mother's face when I told her I was pregnant that first year of our marriage. Then I hear myself telling Stoli what my mother told me before my baby was born: \"Sleep when the baby is sleeping.\" If I didn't, she had said, I could get overtired, which would lead to all kinds of woes, from postpartum depression to mastitis.</p>\n<p>Stoli looks up. \"Mastitis?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's an infection in your milk ducts that is very serious.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom, I'll be fine.\"</p>\n<p>I start to remind her not to let anyone near the baby who hasn't sanitized her hands.</p>\n<p>But then I look at my daughter's peaceful face and at the perfect baby she produced in spite of all my fretting, and instead I share something more helpful that my mother taught me after I had given birth: that used tea bags take the sting out of nursing.</p>\n<p>My mother died when Stoli was a teenager. She will never rock this great-grandbaby, but she is here, in the room with us. You'd think I have been around long enough to know that worry does not make the world turn, love does. You'd think.</p>\n<p>The afternoon of Lani's first day her great-aunt Tanya came to visit, scrubbing her hands well before reaching for her (and thus endearing herself to me forever).</p>\n<p>I was still groggy from being up all night, and thought at first I was dreaming as Tanya floated into the room, all joy and praise. To me, she declared I must be Stoli's sister, that I was too young to be a grandmother. (Honestly, I did not look my best. A daughter's labor adds years to a mother's face.) To Stoli, who was puffy-eyed and tired to her marrow, she exclaimed that she never looked so lovely. It was impossible, Auntie Tanya said, that she had just given birth&#8212;\"Impossible!\" To her nephew she said, \"Oh Nels, oh Nels, oh Nels! How lucky we are!\" Then lightly, reverently, she pressed that baby to her heart and they waltzed across the linoleum. \"The world is so beautiful,\" Auntie Tanya cooed as she swayed&#8212;\"You are so beautiful. We are so lucky.\"</p>\n<p>That's when I decided what kind of grandmother I will be. I will be more like Auntie Tanya. I no longer have to worry. That is Lani's mother's job, although it seems unlikely that she will embrace it. Good for her, the new me says.</p>\n<p>This is the reward for surviving my own childrearing years. This is the secret that no one tells you about being a grandmother. It is not the old joke that grandchildren are great because you can play with them and then give them back to their parents to change and feed. It is that you are no longer the chief worrier. You are now the good cop. A mother must say no, but from the beginning a good grandmother gets to say yes.</p>\n<p>Yes, little darling, you are beautiful and brilliant. Yes, the world is wonderful. Yes, everything is OK, and yes, there is nothing to worry about because your daddy is kind and your mama is happy and your grandma is right here.</p>\n<p><em>HEATHER LENDE is a contributing editor to Woman's Day.

Anyone can now shoot high-definition video on a smartphone and instantly upload it to YouTube for the entire world to see. That type of uncut cinema vert style makes for good cat-playing-piano clips (if there is such a thing), but the videos that are truly important to you deserve more polish. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe best way to get great results in the editing bay is to shoot quality footage in the first place, with a strong sense of the tale you want your video to tell. But it's amazing how a little bit of work in a basic video-editing program can turn some less than perfect clips into a dramatic exercise in visual storytelling. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nResist the impulse toward special effects and other visual tricks&#151;if you don't know how to organize, arrange, and splice your clips into a harmonious narrative, then all that stuff is just decoration on an unbaked cake. Following these simple guidelines will do a lot more for your video.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>1 Unravel the Story</strong></h3><br />\n\nMost consumer-grade video-editing programs are nonlinear, which means they allow you to grab and manipulate your clips without destroying the original material. Software such as Windows Live Movie Maker and Apple's iMovie and shareware such as AVS Video Editor use a storyboard that lets you lay out your clips and rearrange them however you like. Most professional moviemakers would start with a script, then storyboard before they shoot anything. But for clips you've already taken, you're going to have to do that process in reverse. Take the clips you want to use and drag them to the board, then rearrange them until you see a story emerge. Don't worry about clips blending together at this point, just look for a rough sense of narrative progress. Consider the mood and pacing of the footage. Is it sports video with lots of movement and action? Are there lots of closeups and dialogue? Has your subject been shot from multiple angles? The longer you want your movie to be, the more variety you should be looking for. If it seems as if something's missing, make notes about additional footage, or B-roll, you can film to fill in the blanks (iMovie has dummy clips called Animatics that you can use as placeholders).\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>2 Trim the Fat</strong></h3><br />\n\nIt's good to overshoot when it comes to video. But the more footage you have, the more ruthlessly you have to cut in postproduction. The process of editing is all about being selective and stitching together your best material in a way that tells a story efficiently. In each clip, look for the crux of the action and drop anything that's not pivotal. (Most programs let you trim with a simple select and delete.) As a general rule, try keeping clips under 10 seconds&#151;short shots will give your movie a lot more energy than longer ones. That said, don't cut your clips so short that they become confusing.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>3 Clean it Up</strong></h3><br />\n\nIt's best to plan your lighting, composition, and camera technique before you shoot, but in case that didn't happen, there's still plenty you can do with software. The capabilities vary from program to program. Windows Live Movie Maker is the least sophisticated, but if you're willing to tinker with third-party filters, you can use the free, linear VirtualDub program to do some basic corrections, then import the clips into WLMM for editing. More sophisticated video suites such as iMovie and AVS offer cropping, color correction, and stabilization, which can compensate for sloppy camerawork. Tinkering with the image can have a downside, however&#151;digital cropping and stabilization can lower resolution. But used judiciously, these tools can help smooth out variation from clip to clip, or turn a bland shot of someone talking into a dramatic closeup.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>4 Blend It Together</strong></h3><br />\n\nFrequent cuts and angle shifts make a movie more dynamic, but done wrong, these techniques can be jarring. Knowing how to gracefully move from one shot to another is an art form. Most video editors offer lots of fancy sweeps, mosaic dissolves, and other spinning, flipping novelty transitions, but if you trust your material, keep it simple. Transitions are usually found under a menu or palette (some software labels them effects). Don't use too many kinds of transitions&#151;stick to quick cuts for back-and-forth dialogue, crossfades for blending clips together, and fades to either black or white for complete scene changes.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>5 Smooth Out the Soundtrack</strong></h3><br />\n\nUnfortunately, the built-in mics on camcorders and smartphones are uniformly awful for recording dialogue. If you were unfortunate enough to capture Bigfoot's first recorded growl in a windy patch of forest, both AVS and iMovie offer tools to remove background noise. But remember, software can't perform miracles, and while it's advisable to tinker with the audio settings to get the best results, too much noodling will cause muffled distortion. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nKeep in mind that your audio doesn't always have to be tied to your video. If you've got footage of your daughter telling a hilarious story about the family dog chasing its tail, but it's just a still shot of her talking, split the audio track from the video and splice in a shot of the dog spinning around while she tells the story, then cut back to her giggling hysterically at the end&#151;it makes for a far more interesting effect. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nFinally, if your recorded audio is garbage or just irrelevant to the action, drop in some music for a mood-setting soundtrack. Editing together wistful memories of your kid growing up? Dial up the sentiment with some Jack Johnson. Trying to make your hockey team's highlights even more awesome? Lay down a track of AC/DC and match the visual cuts to the rhythm changes. But don't invite the wrath of music industry lawyers&#151;if you're posting to the Web, search for royalty-free music on websites such as <a href=\"http://www.freeplaymusic.com./\">freeplaymusic.com.</a>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b><i>ADVICE FROM AN EXPERT</i></b>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>JOEL NEGRON, </b><i>film editor on</i> Sleepy Hollow, Transformers: Dark of the Moon <i>and</i> 21 Jump Street\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>...on getting organized</b>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Go through your video and make a select reel. It doesn't have to make sense, just get your best footage for each section of the story. Some people make multiple select reels for closeups, wide shots, medium shots, or all shots of each actor.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>...on adding drama</b>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"When editing, I use music from other movies. You can have a shot of a guy just sitting on a bench, and there's nothing happening, but if the music is telling you to feel sad, then you're going to feel sad, and if the music communicates tension, then you're going to feel tension.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>...on filling in the blanks</b>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"If you're editing footage of, say, a football game, and the cameraman filmed a touchdown pass, but missed the ball in the air, then the easiest thing to do is cut to a shot of the crowd, then cut back to the guy running the ball.\"\n\n<br /><br

The men, dressed in MultiCam desert camouflage, deploy from a white government-issued van and immediately start unloading rucksacks and doing leg stretches.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOnly half of the 12-man detachment, part of the 1st Special Forces Group, is available to stalk Rattlesnake Hills on the edge of the city for this morning's PT. One member is injured, another is in sniper training, and the team's Fox (intelligence specialist) is in dive school. The rest are sleeping off the prior night's guard duty at the Yakima Training Center. The clandestine operational detachment is a long way from its home base at Okinawa. The wide, undulating landscape and relentlessly rocky terrain here more closely resemble Afghanistan, where the team is slated to spend 2013. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe men shrug on 30-pound rucks and wordlessly start the brisk march. Boots crunch on gravel in an increasing cadence. The detachment's Alpha (commander) is a 29-year-old captain, a combat veteran who served in the infamously violent Korengal Valley in Afghanistan while with the conventional Army. His Zulu (senior nonenlisted) is a 37-year-old master sergeant; this team has no warrant officer, so the Zulu is second in command. Since this A-Team is readying for a deployment&#151;they call it going downrange&#151;their real names cannot be used. Special operations forces (SOF) value secrecy above everything except physical fitness.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe team's leaders call out a word of warning: No running allowed. \"If one starts, they'll all try to be first,\" Alpha says. \"We all have Type-A personalities on this team.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe trail winds steadily upward, past a handful of isolated ranch homes. As soon as the team sees an opportunity, the members leave the semipaved road and ascend a steep hillside matted with rocks and ankle-high tangles of scrub brush. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe team's senior Echo (communications specialist) pauses to admire the view. He's a sergeant first class with 15 years of experience in the military, including work as a scout and sniper in the conventional Army. His shoulders are broad and so is his grin. He smiles a lot. Yakima never looks better than it does from the crest of a hill at dawn, city lights still glittering under a recently risen sun. \"Kinda makes getting up at oh-five-hundred worth it,\" he says.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA civilian four-wheel all-terrain vehicle is unexpectedly waiting for the team as it finishes zigzagging down the slope. The homeowner driving it quickly endorses the men's presence in a polite hearts-and-minds moment. \"It's okay, if it's you guys,\" he says. \"I have to come out and check on people, since methheads and hookers come up here to do their business sometimes.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIt's considered a light morning of PT; a more typical start to the day consists of a 90-minute run (not including forward and backward sprints up the inclines and a slate of leg-burning squat thrusts) and the first of two daily free-weight workouts. But the next few days and nights at the Army training center will be crammed with lessons in operating vehicles they have never driven before. A brief hike will have to do. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAlpha's men will be among the nearly 10,000 special operators in Afghanistan in 2013, preparing for the administration's 2014 exit of major combat troops. \"While the aggregate number of total personnel in Afghanistan will decrease as we approach 2014, the special operations forces' contribution may increase,\" Adm. William McRaven, head of Special Operations Command (SOCOM), told Congress in March. They will be there until at least 2017.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe expectation in Washington, D.C., is that these teams can take the lead in keeping the Afghan central government in control of a dysfunctional country of 35 million. If they can, America's longest war will end with a qualified win. If they fail, the nation could slip into civil strife and again become a haven for terrorists. \"The rumbling around town is that special operations forces will basically own the U.S. mission in Afghanistan,\" says Travis Sharp, a fellow at the Washington, D.C.&#151;based Center for a New American Security. \"SOF has been on the rise for a decade. Now we are going to see if they can hold and consolidate gains.\" He adds: \"If I trust anyone to get the job done, it'd be SOF.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAlthough Pentagon planners are finishing this war with a geopolitical Hail Mary pass, at least they are relying on the right players. Special operations A-Teams are made of incredible individuals with an action hero's resume of skills: para-jumping, foreign-language fluency, a professional athlete's physical conditioning, and familiarity with an entire catalog of vehicles and weapons. And then there are the specialties: construction and demolitions, communications, intelligence gathering, and battlefield medicine verging on internal surgery. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThese dedicated, sincere men are setting out to tame a land of suicide bombing, systematic abuse of women, and legendary duplicity. They are high-value individuals deploying to a place where human life has little value. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDuring the ruck march, I remark to Zulu that my backpack weighs about 20 pounds less than his. I recycle a line from a <i>Dirty Harry</i> movie to explain my minimalist packing: \"A man's got to know his limitations.\" The 37-year-old Zulu shoots me a skeptical look. \"Oh, really?\" he says. It's clear I have spoken heresy. Admitting something can't be done is not in these guys' DNA.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>The Soft Side of Special Ops</strong></h3><br />\n\nWhen most people think of special operations, they think of lightning-fast raids that target terrorist leaders. The killing of Osama bin Laden was the capstone on a decade of aggressive wartime missions that the military calls direct-action, or kinetic, missions. Although presidents have virtually no control over the planning or execution of these missions, they can be elected or booted from office based on their outcomes. Just ask Jimmy Carter, who signed off on an ill-fated hostage rescue in Iran. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDirect action, with its associated stealthy recon, building breaches, helicopter repelling, and double-tap gunshots&#151;fits a violent stereotype of spec ops that does not match the reality. SOCOM has another mandate: to prepare other nations to take care of themselves. \"The selection process is very good at weeding out anyone who only wants to shoot people in the face,\" Alpha says. \"We need warrior-politicians.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThese \"indirect-action\" missions include training foreign troops and teaching locals how to establish responsible governments. The strategy also promotes economic development by building bazaars, encouraging farmers to grow extra food crops to sell, and constructing roads. No one makes video games based on indirect-action missions.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe public may not have a good grasp on SOCOM's activities, but Washington, D.C., is increasingly relying on its broad mandate to counter global instability. Since 2001, SOCOM's ranks have doubled and are funded to grow from 66,100 to 71,100 by 2015. Its budgets tripled since 2001 to a 2012 tally of $10.5 billion. The tempo of deployments has risen too: the command's personnel (not all A-Teams) now work in at least 75 nations, 15 more than the total at the end of the Bush administration. \"I expect the operational demands placed on special operations forces to increase across the next decade and beyond,\" McRaven says. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nSOCOM has become the U.S. government's tool of choice for soft power projection, but this is partly by default. \"Most of our resources, when it comes to these types of efforts, are placed in the Department of Defense,\" says Rick Nelson, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who served with Joint Special Operations Command. \"The reality is that the State Department and USAID are not funded at appropriate levels.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nSpec ops has become a tempting option for civilian policymakers. Teams are easy to send into the field because they can be deployed with little disclosure to the public or to regional allies, minimal advance warning, and fewer bureaucratic approvals. \"The U.S. government is at risk of seeing SOF as a panacea for all of America's security problems in the world,\" Travis Sharp says. \"There is a reasonable limit to what they can accomplish and remain sustainable.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe nation-building aspect of SOCOM's work is increasing as the war efforts recede and kill/capture raids become rarer. But those who assist SOCOM&#151;Congress, which pays, and conventional forces, who contribute airlift, bases, and support personnel&#151;may not be eager to aid the kinder, gentler SOCOM missions.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"The spotlight has been on the kinetic operations against high-value targets,\" says Adm. Eric Olson, former head of SOCOM. \"Everybody lines up to support those, with a full capability and budgets.\" His concern is that as SOF leave battlefields, the smaller, less violent operations won't get the attention they need: \"Instead of having the spotlight on special operations forces shift, I think it will just dim.\" \n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/the-future-of-special-ops-9077296-2\">Echo On Wheels >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/K2/spec-ops-02-0712-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-07-10T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Pappalardo","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9077296","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/military/news/the-sun-never-sets-on-special-ops-10503978\">The Sun Never Sets on Special Ops </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/news/the-future-of-special-ops-9077296\">The Future of Special Ops </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/6-special-ops-missions-and-their-lessons-for-the-bin-laden-raid\">6 Special Ops Missions&mdash;and Their Lessons for the bin Laden Raid</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/us-special-ops-building-satellites-to-track-terrorists-everywhere-5767401\">U.S .

But so did a lot of fathers. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMy dad was different. When I was a boy, he set aside a midlevel marketing job of regular moves and little passion to follow his bliss: He wanted to start his own business. The first, an automotive bookstore, lasted only a few years. The second, a restoration shop that specialized in cantankerous European sports cars, existed in one form or another until I hit college. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThat shop meant a lot to me. After school, I'd hang around my father's toolbox, watching him spin wrenches and solve problems. He had been teaching me to work on cars for years, but the shop was a stark cementing of principles. It made everything real. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nI didn't think much of this&#151;and didn't realize how important it was to me&#151;until one night in the fall of 1998, when I was 17. Dad and I drove 10 hours from our home in Kentucky to Watkins Glen, N.Y., for the 50th anniversary of the first postwar American sports car race, held on the town's closed-off streets. Amateur drivers had flown around the town's houses at full tilt, with only hay bales and bunting separating them from packed spectators. It was the beginning of the country's modern speed era, a moment as significant as the inaugural Indianapolis 500 back in 1911. The area went on to host everything from IndyCars to Formula One&#151;from Andretti to Zanardi.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Glen's public road races are gone, victims of safety concerns, but the heart of that culture lives on at an Adirondack-style resort called Seneca Lodge, which sits on a hill overlooking town. The lodge hasn't changed much since 1948, and most people hope it never will, because it houses the most famous racing bar in America.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMy father took me there on our first night at the lodge back in '98. A gentle and relatively quiet man, he didn't give me much warning that we were about to enter hallowed ground, a temple that has welcomed drivers since Truman was president. Instead, he just paused at the door and said, \"This place is important.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Seneca Lodge bar turned out to be no larger than a two-car garage, unprepossessing and poorly lit. Tattered photographs of dead drivers were pinned above the bar. Browned victory wreaths hung from darkly varnished walls. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut the place was filled with legends&#151;heroes I had read about since I was a little boy. Formula One drivers and team managers sat in the corners, including 16-time Grand Prix winner Stirling Moss of Britain. American John Fitch, who won at Sebring and raced six times at Le Mans, was at a table with other winners who had too many checkered flags to their credit to count. There was pioneering American sports car driver and journalist Denise McCluggage. They were all in town for the anniversary, a living rogues' gallery from the stories of my youth. Dad and I stood there for a moment, soaking it all in, before he moved on to greet a few friends.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn that moment, I knew ... well, I wasn't sure what I knew. But something clicked. A part of my life began to make sense. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn the years since, Dad and I have raced together and fixed cars together, and last summer we again walked through the door of the Seneca Lodge bar. The night wasn't as celebratory for the patrons there, but we were both thrilled, and not just to be back. We were about to fulfill a dream&#151;a cross-country journey together to trace the history of American road racing, something we had wanted to do for years. Naturally, we started at the Glen. And for reasons both patriotic and reverent, we decided to make the trip in a 2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe V-8-powered Boss is no ordinary Mustang. This is a rolling homage to the Boss 302s that contested the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-American (aka Trans-Am) racing championship from 1969 to 1970. It's a snarly collection of historical cues (C-shaped side stripes, rocker-mounted side-pipe exhausts) and legitimate performance cred (adjustable dampers, limited-slip differential, Brembo brakes, optional Recaro seats). In terms of emotional appeal and over-the-road talent, it might be the greatest ponycar ever built.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe idea was to drive the Boss from Watkins Glen to California's Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey. Along the way, we'd stop at a vintage race at Wisconsin's Road America, test the Ford's talents at a track day, and just generally inhale a bunch of blacktop.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe spent most of the first night in the Seneca bar, which felt like a return to baptismal waters for me. The next morning, Dad pulled a dog&#151;eared copy of Dave Friedman's <i>Trans-Am: The Pony Car Wars 1966&#151;1972</i> from his luggage. The book is packed with hero drivers and pictures of Mustangs being shotgunned around places like Laguna, which hosted the final race of Ford's championship-winning 1970 Trans-Am season. This is where I learned that my father, a lifelong European-sports-car nut, has always had a soft spot for big V-8s. While loading the car, I walked out into the parking lot and found him staring at the Boss, arms crossed, giggling. My dad doesn't giggle. Memo to Ford: Whatever you're doing here, keep it up. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe gunned out of the Seneca at 9 am, sun glinting off the Boss's long nose. Fifteen minutes later, remembering a recent conversation with a Ford engineer, I pulled into a Walmart. \"I forgot,\" I said. \"I need to buy a cheap wrench.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"What for?\" Dad asked.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"For America,\" I said.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nCrawling underneath the Mustang in the parking lot&#151;we used a parking curb as a jacking ramp&#151;I loosened the exhaust brackets and pulled the factory-installed noise-abatement plates out of the side pipes, transforming the Boss's 5.0-liter V-8 from a subtle rumbler to a rolling peace disturbance. \"This is great,\" I said, blasting up an on-ramp. \"You think we'll get tired of it?\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"I can't hear you!\" Dad yelled. \"Can we make it louder?\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIt soon became apparent that the Boss, like most Mustangs, is happiest just above the speed limit. The car eased into a long-legged lope that implied California was just over the horizon. Pennsylvania and Ohio flew by, the newly opened side pipes crackling every time we stopped for fuel.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/a-father-a-son-and-the-ford-mustang-boss-302-9077288-2\">What Is It About Loud Cars >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/3C/mustang-boss-302-02-0712-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-07-09T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Smith","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9077288","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/cars/news/pictures/2012-ford-mustang-boss-302-test-drive-gallery\">2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 Test Drive: Gallery</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/reviews/drives/2012-ford-mustang-boss-302-test-drive\">2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 Test Drive</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/news/vintage-speed/a-father-a-son-and-the-ford-mustang-boss-302-9077288\">A Father, a Son, and the Ford Mustang Boss 302 </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/reviews/comparisons/ford-mustang-boss-302-vs-chevy-camaro-ss-1le\">Ford Mustang Boss 302 vs. Chevy Camaro SS 1LE</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/behind-the-wheel-of-the-ford-mustang-boss-302-laguna-seca-video\">Behind the Wheel of the Ford Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/2012-ford-mustang-boss-302-laguna-seca\">2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 and Boss 302 Laguna Seca</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/2012-ford-mustang-boss-302-laguna-seca-gallery\">2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca: Picture Gallery</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/news/4292374\">Live From the 2008 L.A.

Serious bug watchers think they've observed a recent decline, but scientists aren't certain&#151;firefly populations go through natural booms and busts. Getting a read on them is difficult, says Don Salvatore, coordinator of the Firefly Watch project at the Museum of Science, Boston. \"Fireflies are much more complex than people realize,\" he says. \"It's not like counting birds or flowers or butterflies.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNow, firefly fans across the U.S. can help scientists gather crucial data while spending leisurely evenings in their own backyards. Firefly Watch provides tips for identifying telltale flash patterns; in return, volunteers submit weekly observations, plus details about their local landscape. Such information may help scientists tease out the effects of lawn mowing, pesticides, and light pollution (fireflies' flashes, the insect equivalent of a listing on Match.com, can be drowned out by porch lights and streetlights).

Each species has a distinct flash pattern, which speeds up or slows down according to the temperature. Here are seven of the most common.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>1 SPECIES:</strong> <i>Photinus consimilis</i> [slow pulse] // <strong>GLOW:</strong> yellow-green // <strong>MALE FLASH PATTERN:</strong>

Bamboo thrown on a fire in China explodes as air expands inside the reeds, and rudimentary firecrackers are born. Locals decide they should be used to scare away evil spirits.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>A.D. 600 TO 900:</strong></span> Things get pyrotechnical when a Chinese alchemist combines sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal and sets it on fire. The more oxygen-rich the saltpeter, the bigger the explosion. Soon the Chinese pack powder, rocks, and metal into containers to make weapons.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1295:</strong></span> Marco Polo brings fireworks to Europe from the Orient. (Also: porcelain, jewels, spices, and other less exciting items that don't go boom.)\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1400 TO 1500:</strong></span> The Renaissance begets unparalleled advances in art, literature&#151;and fireworks. The Italians launch projectiles and burn powdered metals and charcoal slowly in open tubes to create sparklers. Controlled fires become de rigueur at coronations. Commoners miss out on the fun.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1635:</strong></span> John Bate publishes the four-part book series <i>The Mysteries of Nature and Art</i>. In part two, he outlines how to create flying dragons, along with other fiery spectacles.

In England, fireworks shows become public spectacles for everyone to enjoy. Colonists bring them to the Americas, where they set them off on Independence Day 1777 and think, we should do this again next year.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1830s:</strong></span> Italian pyrotechnicians add color to fireworks with chlorinated powder and metallic salts (strontium = red, barium = green, copper = blue, sodium = yellow). Using potassium chlorate as an oxidizer makes the hues brighter.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1966:</strong></span> Cherry bombs, first used as weapons during the Civil War, are banned in the U.S. But until his death in 1978, Keith Moon, drummer of the Who, blows off steam&#151;and blows up hotel toilets&#151;with illegal cherry bombs. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1976:</strong></span> The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires fuses on consumer fireworks to burn for at least 3 seconds but no more than 9. Safety warnings on fireworks labels become protocol.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1999:</strong></span> Disney World launches fireworks with compressed air instead of gunpowder at Epcot's pyrotechnic spectacular <i>IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth</i>.

I'd like to meet you. </strong>Introducing yourself and asking about the conditions at the beach or pool is always a good idea. \"We want you to ask, 'What's the water like?' 'Any areas that I should steer clear of?' 'Where does the deep end start?'\" says Luiz Morizot-Leite, ocean rescue captain at the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department in Miami and a lifeguard for 17 years. If possible, stand in front of the lifeguard so he doesn't have to take his eyes off the water. Yes, safety rules, current conditions and warnings are usually posted, but people often don't read the signs or understand how the information applies to them.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Stay hydrated.</strong> Treat swimming just as you would any other physical activity by drinking plenty of water before, during and after a swim. Your body still loses water even though you're <em>in</em> water. And while your body may stay cool in the pool or ocean, the sun can still dehydrate you&#151;so drink up!</p>\n<p><strong>3) Skip the floaties. </strong>Devices like noodles and arm floaties can easily come off, pop or slip out of a child's hands, says Nikki Bowie, safety program manager at the Charleston County Park and Recreation Commission in Charleston, SC, and a lifeguard for 32 years. A Coast Guard&#151;approved life jacket is the only flotation device you should use. Even so, stay within arm's reach of your child.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Don't bury yourself in the sand.</strong> Lying under a mound of sand with just your head, hands and feet sticking out may make a funny photo, but lifeguards say it's not worth the risk. Due to beach erosion, the bottom of the hole can give way in an instant and become dangerous. Never dig farther than knee-deep of the smallest person in your group. \"Last summer, it took a rescue team 4 to 5 hours to get someone out of a hole, and he was having trouble breathing,\" says Morizot-Leite.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Lightning is the biggest risk when you're <em>out </em>of the water. </strong>Lightning often strikes the tallest object, and at the beach, that's you. So when the lifeguard announces that everyone must clear the beach or pool, do it <em>immediately</em>. \"People say, 'I'm just going to take a minute to pack up,' but lightning can strike in 60 seconds or less,\"says Butch Arbin, captain of the Ocean City, MD, beach patrol and a lifeguard for 40 years.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Be realistic about your swim skills.</strong> \"People often misjudge distance <em>and</em> overestimate their endurance,\" says Morizot-Leite. \"They think, <em>I can see the shoreline or the other end of the pool from here, so it's not that far,</em>\" he explains. \"So they swim out, then become exhausted on their way back and need to be rescued.\" At the beach, exhaustion is also a big danger because of rip currents. More than 80% of ocean rescues are due to these powerful, narrow channels of quickly moving water that pull you away from the shore (not under water). \"People drown because they panic and expend all their energy trying to swim back to shore,\" says Bowie. The key to survival is to stay calm and swim parallel to the shoreline.

heard that artificial sweeteners can make you crave more sweets. So why do weight loss plans encourage eating foods&#151;like yogurt&#151;with artificial sweeteners? &#151;HILARY SHEFFLER HOWARD, ATHOL, ID","__total_count__":2,"sender":"HILARY SHEFFLER HOWARD, ATHOL, ID","answer":"Diet sodas get more negative attention because they have zero nutrition. Yogurt, however, has some positives (protein and calcium) along with the artificial sweeteners. My advice is to limit your intake of artificially sweetened foods and drinks to two a day, because they keep the sweet taste on your mind and taste buds, which can make it harder to beat sugar cravings.\n\nAs for yogurts, I prefer those with a little real sugar. Look for flavored ones with no more than 14 g sugar per 4-oz container and no more than 20 g per 6-oz. (This includes the sugar that's naturally found in yogurt from lactose and from fruit pur&#233;e, honey or other added sweeteners.) Of course, less is best! Most flavored nonfat Greek yogurts meet my cutoff."},{"question":"Should I eat more on days when I exercise a lot? &#151;LAUREN BAILEY, NEW YORK","__total_count__":2,"sender":"","answer":"Most of us usually don't exercise enough to justify extra calories. But here's a general guideline: Multiply your weight by 13. The total is how many calories you should eat daily, whether you're not exercising at all or if you're working out moderately for an hour or less (walking, swimming, doing an exercise DVD). On days when you exercise for more than an hour, add 100 to 200 calories per additional hour. So if you took a two-hour hike, for example, add 150 calories to a snack or meal that day. If your energy is flagging during a particularly active week, try adding more protein to breakfast (a scoop of cottage cheese, an egg) and snacks (a handful of almonds, string cheese).\n<p><em>Do you have a question for Joy?

So <em>Woman's Day</em> sent designer Annie Selke to transform an unused basement into a playroom the whole family can spread out in.</p>\n<p>\"It's impossible not to feel excited when you come into the new space,\" says Beth, here with husband Mike, and twin sons Aiden (<em>left</em>) and Christopher (<em>right</em>).</p>\n<p>Five years ago, Beth and Mike Hopkins were thrilled to find an affordable small house in Suffield, CT. \"We were both born and raised in New England and loved the charm of the area,\" says Beth. \"But the house was over 40 years old and had never been updated. Our plan was to put a lot of work into it and then trade up to something bigger.\" They wasted no time getting started: \"We closed on the house the day before my wedding shower, and a few hours later, Mike and I had already started ripping up linoleum and gutting a bathroom.\"</p>\n<p>Over the next two years, the couple added closets, removed walls, put down a walkway and rebuilt a porch. After twins Aiden and Christopher were born in February 2009, Beth quit her job. At around the same time, Mike lost his. He quickly found work selling life insurance, but because his salary is entirely commission-based, it's wildly unpredictable. \"We went from living pretty comfortably to worrying that we were going to lose our home,\" says Beth.</p>\n<p><strong>Crowded House</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the boys&#151;now rambunctious 3-year-olds&#151;were growing and, well, being boys. \"No matter how much I tidied up, there were always toys strewn everywhere,\" says Beth. \"My husband joked that it looked like we ran a day-care center.\" The Hopkinses had definitely outgrown their ranch house, but there was no room in the budget for turning the huge unfinished basement into a family room. \"We're big do-it-yourselfers, but this was just too large a project for us,\" Beth admits. So when she saw a call for makeover candidates in <em>Woman's Day,</em> she wrote in.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Solved!</strong></p>\n<p>Enter Massachusetts-based designer Annie Selke, author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Fresh-American-Spaces-Romantic-Exuberant/dp/0307716066/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336418171&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh American Spaces</a>,</em> who added vibrancy to the new playroom with colorful furniture and accessories and bright paint. Her biggest challenge was to strike a balance between fun and functionality&#151;and the result was a big hit with the whole family. \"Seeing the boys get so excited to go down and play in their own little world has been wonderful for Mike and me,\" says Beth. \"After everything we've been through over the past few years, we needed this. It was a real blessing for us.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wanted to make this room bright and fun for the kids but practical for the adults,\" says Annie Selke (<em>slide 7</em>, with Beth).</p>","slide_title":"Room to Grow","custom_slide_links":[{"slide_links":[{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":1,"link_url":"","link_thumb_url":"","link_title":"","link_text":""}],"__total_count__":1,"link_heading":""}],"slide_credit":"Annie Schlechter","slide_links_type":"Magnus","sponsorship":"Nothing","slide_type":"Image"}],"article_type_name":"Flip Book 3","publish_date":"2012-06-28T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"987562","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20747","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/OY/1-family-home-makeover-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Underwood","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"flipbook3","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8657705","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1365","last_updated_date":"2012-06-28T19:46:49.000Z","author_id":"16370","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-07T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/home/decorating-ideas/upgrade-your-starter-home","issue_date":"Woman's Day;

The Oshkosh, WI, mom just wanted her son, Jarod&#151;diagnosed with autism at 18 months&#151;to overcome his terror of them. \"Our neighbors and my brothers have dogs,\" says Wendy, 37. \"Jarod would have a meltdown anytime he saw one.\" Worse, she says, \"He couldn't connect with people at all.\"</p>\n<p>A friend at the school where Wendy taught told her about a puppy he was raising for Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), a national organization that provides dogs who alert their deaf owners to sounds like the phone ringing, perform tasks for the physically disabled such as turning on lights, and help the developmentally disabled overcome social isolation. Wendy thought, <em>Could a CCI dog help Jarod?</em> \"I desperately wanted him to have a friend, someone to give him unconditional love,\" she says.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Jarod, then 9, and his two younger sisters asked their parents for a cat. They all went to the shelter, where \"this huge cat wrapped himself around our ankles,\" says Wendy. Moose quickly became part of the family. \"A week later,\" says Wendy, \"my neighbor called and said, 'You have to come over.'\" Jarod was on the floor with the neighbor's dog, gently stroking his fur. Wendy realized that taking care of Moose, combined with the cat's affection, had helped break down Jarod's fear of other animals. Maybe he was ready for a CCI dog.</p>\n<p>In May 2011, Wendy, her mother-in-law and Jarod traveled to the CCI training center in Ohio to meet Flash, a Labrador and golden retriever mix, and learn how to work with him. The boy-dog connection was immediate.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, they brought Flash home. The dog's main job is to calm Jarod, who is prone to anxiety. Upsetting changes in routine and hurt feelings can cause him to lose control. When this occurs, he says, \"Flash, lap!\" and the dog puts his chest and front legs over him. \"I give him a hug,\" says Jarod, \"and snuggle his cute fur. Then I feel happy.\" The weight, warmth and affection soothe the boy, and help him learn to quiet himself on his own.</p>\n<p>Jarod has made strides that Wendy never dared imagine. When he and Flash are out in public, Jarod happily answers questions about his dog. And he's more spontaneously affectionate at home. Plus, the routine of Flash's daily care has built his confidence. \"Flash doesn't care that Jarod is different,\" says Wendy. \"He doesn't judge.\"</p>\n<p>Now, she says, \"Rather than retreating into his own world all the time, Jarod is part of ours.

A growing number of psychologists believe that a new generation of gadgets designed to monitor your every move, track your food intake and provide continuous, detailed progress reports, could have the power to transform your fitness. It&#146;s based on the principle of the &#145;feedback loop&#146;.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;Apps have huge potential because they let you self-monitor and track your progress without the trouble of carrying around a diary,&#148; says Dr Eric Robinson, a behavioural psychologist at the University of Birmingham who is using feedback loops to build his own weight-loss app. &#147;Real-time feedback is particularly useful with eating.&#148;</p>\n\n<p>Indeed it is. A review of 22 studies on self-monitoring concluded that people using this technique lose consistently more weight than those who don&#146;t. It&#146;s a similar principle to those road signs that flash up your speed when you&#146;re driving: pricking your conscience in this way prompts you slow down.</p>\n\n<p>If the same thing happens when you&#146;re choosing what to eat, with the flash showing the calorie-toll of your previous meal, you&#146;re much more likely to reach for salad instead of the microwave mash. At least that&#146;s the theory. To find out whether it actually works, I immersed myself in feedback. I downloaded apps, littered my office with belt-clips, shoe-chips, wristbands, pedometers, pulse monitors and wireless weighing scales. The target: to end a year-long health rut and shift my persistent flab.</p>\n\n<h2>The fat truth</h2>\n<p>First, I wanted to improve my eating habits. Calorie counters are the most prevalent tool and the best I found was <a href=\"http://www.mynetdiary.com/mobile-calorie-counters.html\" target=\"_blank\">MyNetDiary</a>, which had an easy barcode scanner and excellent nutritional reporting. However, many of the apps and gadgets require you to register and ask for an off-putting amount of manual input. That&#146;s not feedback &#150; it&#146;s data entry, which I don&#146;t find motivating.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#146;t want to spend 10 minutes number crunching just to find out that I can&#146;t have a packet of crisps.\nThe <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/thin-cam/id360217012?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Thin-Cam app</a> was less laborious. Photograph whatever you eat and the picture enters a visual food journal. It&#146;s quick and easy, and my greed was outed like the shameful table of food presented to obese people on TV. I could no longer eat a pork pie without being confronted by yesterday&#146;s pork pie. So I stopped.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;This works because it links our long-term goals with the thousands of little steps we have to take to reach them,&#148; explains Jeremy Snape, sports psychologist at coaching firm Sporting Edge. &#147;It&#146;s useful because it works at an everyday level. &#148;This allows us to feel pleasingly smug about our small triumphs, even if a six-pack doesn&#146;t appear overnight.</p>\n\n<p>GPS apps use the same idea, reminding me of just how few kilometres I&#146;d clocked on a run. This feedback transformed my lazy jog into a time trial against me from yesterday &#150; and I wasn&#146;t about to let retro-fatty win.</p>\n\n<p>The most effective running app was <a href=\"http://www.mapmyfitness.com/imapmy/\" target=\"_blank\">MapMyFitness</a>, although I discovered another flaw with some feedback loops: accuracy. When the GPS link drops out the run can&#146;t be tracked precisely. I simply lost trust in the data.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;Some activity monitors and apps don&#146;t have many sensors,&#148; says Anna Holder, lead scientist at Ki Performance, which produces the <a href=\"http://www.kiperformance.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Ki Fit monitor</a>. The Ki Fit contains four sensors compared to the usual one or two.</p>\n\n<p>It does, however, cost &#163;195 with three months&#146; subscription fees. You get what you pay for.\nFor me, the best feedback loops were the simple ones. <a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/uk/product/mobile/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Fitbit</a>, a wearable tracker, sends you a weekly progress report. The <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/weightbot-track-your-weight/id293642937?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Weightbot</a> app displays a graph of your weight against your target. The <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/iphonedrinks.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">NHS Drinks Tracker</a> shows your booze intake compared to national guidelines. I even set an alarm to go off every morning, with notes about why I should eat fruit for breakfast, not pancakes. All simple. All successful.</p>\n\n<h2>Use people power</h2>\n<p>After just a week of near-constant feedback I&#146;d lost 4lb and wiped 10 minutes off my PB. To me, that&#146;s proof that feedback loops work. Whether I&#146;ll keep the arsenal of gadgetry, I&#146;m not so sure &#150; but the beauty is that you don&#146;t need to. The real benefit was reminding me of the importance of targets. All I need is a stopwatch, a diary and some other human beings.</p>\n\n<p>People are, after all, the original feedback loop. Despite the geeky joy I got from the tech, the most powerful tool was my wife. I asked her for some real-time non-numerical feedback. She said my man-boobs looked bouncy. I went for a jog.</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-06-20T06:33:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8893837","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/fitness/felix-baumgartner-fitness\">Out of this world fitness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/trouble-finding-fitness-171266\">Trouble finding fitness ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/sickness-rip\">Sickness RIP</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/exercise-computer-games\">MH tests exercise computer games</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sweepstakes/20913\">Sign up to our newsletter and win a Remington Touch Control Beard &amp;

I've been mixing tons of prints. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Best all-time fashion moment</strong></p>\n\n<p>My wedding dress because it was made with love.

says Michele Borba, EdD, author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Book-Parenting-Solutions/dp/0787988316/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335725156&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">The Big Book of Parenting Solutions</a></em>. Before you have another child over, try a group play date at the park so you can pick up valuable intel&#151;from the other parent&#146;s discipline style to what types of foods or conversations are off-limits. If the kids are too old to hang out with you, call the other mom before the first get-together. And during the kids&#146; meet-up, ask yourself, &#147;Will what I&#146;m about to say infringe upon another parent&#146;s rights and values?&#148; The following eight remarks definitely do, so avoid them at all costs.</p>\n<p><strong>1. &#147;I&#146;m sorry your family&#146;s going through a tough time.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Of course you mean well, but saying &#147;I&#146;m sorry your mom lost her job&#148; or &#147;&#133;your dad&#146;s sick&#148; can make a child feel worse, says Borba. Instead, let the child be your guide. If he&#146;s a de facto member of your family and seems eager to vent, you can ask, &#147;Do you need a hug?&#148; or &#147;Do you want to go out for ice cream?&#148; On the other hand, he may want to escape what&#146;s going on at home, so let him play without asking questions. Another reason to steer clear of &#147;I&#146;m sorry&#148; statements: The child may be clueless, in which case you&#146;ve just spilled a family secret, says Linda Sonna, PhD, a psychologist and author of the <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580628702/qid=1095024049/sr=1-7\" target=\"_blank\">Everything Tween Book</a></em>. That&#146;s why it pays to check in with other parents before you have their child over.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&#160;<strong>&#147;Come to church with us!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to religion and politics, many parents prefer you don&#146;t share your point of view. &#147;You have to exercise restraint,&#148; says David Bakke, a single dad in Atlanta, GA. &#147;I&#146;ve heard other kids say they don&#146;t believe in Christmas and I don&#146;t dispute what they say. But once at a birthday party, another parent told my five-year-old that he didn&#146;t have to love God if he didn&#146;t want to. I was furious&#151;I&#146;d told my son that loving God is an important part of Christianity, and that remark disrupted his religious upbringing.&#148; Even an innocent invitation to tag along to your house of worship the morning after a sleepover could be construed as an effort to preach your values. Get the parents&#146; okay the day before or drop off the child at his home before heading to church, says Borba.</p>\n<p><strong>3. &#147;Don&#146;t worry&#151;you&#146;ll grow. You&#146;re just a late bloomer.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;My son went through puberty late, so for years he was the shortest kid in class,&#148; says Fernanda Moore, of Swarthmore, PA. <strong>&#160;&#147;</strong>I&#146;d hear parents tell him, &#145;I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll be tall because both your parents are. You&#146;re just a late bloomer!&#146; Or they&#146;d put it in the third person and say the same to me when he and his friend were in earshot.&#148; Though you&#146;re trying to make your kid&#146;s buddy feel better, he&#146;s probably focusing on the negative. &#147;He&#146;s hearing you say, &#145;You&#146;re short and there&#146;s something wrong with you, but eventually you&#146;ll be normal,&#146;&#148; says Denene Millner, founder of the blog <a href=\"http://mybrownbaby.com/\" target=\"_blank\">My Brown Baby</a> and mom of two girls. In general, don&#146;t make comments that aren&#146;t 100% complimentary about kids&#146; appearance, she adds.</p>\n<p><strong>4. &#147;I&#146;m giving you a time-out!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Different families have different rules, so it&#146;s likely your child&#146;s friend will break one of yours at some point. Even if your blood&#146;s boiling because a playmate rudely demanded a snack or shoved your child, don&#146;t punish, yell, or show your anger, says Borba. Instead, calmly explain the rules (&#147;In this house we say please&#148; or &#147;In this house there&#146;s no shoving&#148;) and suggest the kids take a break from each other for a few (a sneaky way to give a time-out sans stigma). Even better, let your grade-schooler explain the rules to her pal, suggests Dr. Sonna. &#147;It pulls you out of the discipline role and boosts your child&#146;s leadership skills.&#148; No matter how you handle the situation, give the mom a heads-up about what went down&#151;that way, you don&#146;t get bad-mouthed when your child&#146;s friend gives her version of the story.</p>\n<p><strong>5. &#147;Didn&#146;t your parents teach you to&#133;?&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Citing the house rules works for some smaller infractions too. For instance, if a playmate eats pasta with her hands in your home, resist remarking on how she was raised. Negative comments about other people&#146;s parenting belong on the forbidden list, says Dr. Sonna. Instead say, &#147;In our house we use a fork to eat.&#148; What about when you&#146;re faced with a picky eater? You may be tempted to tell Finicky Fiona that her parents should&#146;ve made her more adventurous, but hold your tongue. As much as it stinks to make one special grilled-cheese sandwich when you thought your planned menu was kid-friendly, &#147;In our house we eat hot dogs&#148; won&#146;t fly here.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6. &#147;There&#146;s no such thing as the tooth fairy.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>From the Easter Bunny to Santa, every family has cherished rituals that are hard to give up, even when their child is old enough to start questioning them. If your kid&#146;s classmate is asking you if the tooth fairy or Santa are real, chances are he&#146;s not getting the scoop from his mom and dad. Instead of breaking the news, sidestep the topic, advises Borba. &#147;Ask: &#145;What do you think? What are your friends saying?&#146;&#148; Then, tell his mom or dad that he was asking so they can figure out if it&#146;s time to &#145;fess up, she adds.</p>\n<p><strong>7. &#147;What are wet dreams? Here&#146;s the lowdown&#133;&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;My husband and I always answer our daughters&#146; questions, no matter how uncomfortable they make us,&#148; says Millner. So when her six- and nine-year-old nephews talked about wet dreams and periods in the car with her same-age daughters, Millner and her husband answered their questions and told the other parents what they&#146;d done. &#147;Let&#146;s just say they weren&#146;t pleased. At all. They thought it was their responsibility to tell their sons about puberty and they didn't even think their older child was ready for the conversation. We didn't necessarily agree, but we respected that they should&#146;ve had the opportunity to talk with their children first, so we apologized,&#148; she says. The lesson? &#147;Answer questions in a basic way; then, tell the child to ask his parents for more details,&#148; she says. The same guideline applies to hot-button issues like drugs, drinking and abortion.</p>\n<p><strong>8. &#147;Who&#146;s Jack? Emma talks about him a lot&#151;does she like him?&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>What mom doesn&#146;t want to know more about her increasingly private tween&#146;s life? But seeking info from your child&#146;s peers is a manipulative move, and puts friends in a tight spot, says Dr. Sonna. If one spills, she betrays your child&#146;s trust; if she doesn&#146;t, she&#146;ll start avoiding you&#151;and strengthen that &#147;us vs. your mom&#148; mindset your tween&#146;s tempted to develop. If you&#146;re curious about what&#146;s going on with your kid, drive the gang more often so you can overhear her conversations. The exception to the no-grilling rule: You&#146;re worried about your child&#146;s safety or reputation, says Borba.

But what really gave her goosebumps were the days when kids with life-threatening illnesses were whisked to the set for a day of magical escapism. She loved when the makeup artists placed lightning bolts on the foreheads of the tiny patients and gave them their own Hogwarts robes. But talking to the kids' families brought harsh reality crashing down: \"I remember saying to one parent, 'You must have so many people helping you out,' and he responded, 'Are you kidding? People aren't calling; they're not coming over. We're living every parent's worst nightmare,'\" says Paula, whose own husband battled colon cancer 11 years ago. \"I realized that these families really needed help.\" So in 2005, she quit her job as an associate producer and returned home to Boulder, CO, to start <a href=\"http://www.therewithcare.org/\" target=\"_blank\">There With Care</a>, a nonprofit that lightens the load for parents of critically ill children. More than 500 volunteers in Boulder and, now, the San Francisco Bay area tackle everyday tasks like delivering cooked meals, baby sitting the families' other kids, and giving rides to chemo appointments. Beth Krodel remembers the moment last spring when her 4-year-old son was diagnosed with lymphoma: \"Paula went home for us, fed our cats, and filled a suitcase with our clothes so we could stay overnight,\" says Beth. \"I'm so grateful that she was there to handle the stuff we were too preoccupied to think about.\" You can help bring hope and support to many more families--just go to <a href=\"http://www.therewithcare.org/how-to-help\" target=\"_blank\">therewithcare.org/how-to-help</a> to get involved.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>4 MORE WAYS TO HELP SICK KIDS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Sell<strong></strong>lemonade with your kids and send the money you bank to Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.alexslemonade.org/get_involved\" target=\"_blank\">alexslemonade.org/get_involved</a>), a group started in honor of Alexandra Scott, who passed away from neuroblastoma when she was 8 years old. Since 2004, the group has raised an astounding $50 million for children's cancer research.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Volunteer to cook meals or host fun events at one of more than 175 Ronald McDonald Houses (<a href=\"http://www.rmhc.org/how-you-can-help/volunteer\" target=\"_blank\">rmhc.org/how-you-can-help/volunteer</a>), where families can stay for little or no cost if their child is hospitalized far from home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Cheer up a kid in treatment by sending a toy directly to a children's hospital in your area. Go to <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/donate\" target=\"_blank\">childsplaycharity.org/donate</a> to find out how.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Encourage your kids to send a birthday card to the sibling of a sick child through SuperSibs! Go to <a href=\"http://www.supersibs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">supersibs.org</a> and click on \"Get Involved.\" \"It's hard to watch my brother go through this,\" says Aidan, 11, whose 14-year-old brother has a brain tumor. \"But getting packages from SuperSibs! makes me happy. He has three months left of treatment, then we'll play hockey again. He's my best friend.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-19T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1517374","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/oN/rbk-sick-child-0712-1-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Meyers","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8936594","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

Sew down the back of the body and head and fill with stuffing. Sew down the inner legs to the tips<br />of the toes. Fill with stuffing as you go as the legs are thin.</p>\n<p><strong>Arms</strong><br />Sew up the arm seams, filling with stuffing as you go. Sew the arms on to the body using the neck shaping to help with<br />positioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Hair</strong><br />Thread a long length of yarn onto a thick needle (I used 2 lengths of yarn to make it quicker). Sew 1cm (&#189;in) stitches around the edge of the head to form the shape of the hairline. Try to work the stitches in the direction that real hair takes. Fill in the gaps with more stitches until the whole head is covered.</p>\n<p><strong>Facial features</strong><br />Embroider eyes using brown or black yarn. Using the skin-coloured yarn, pull up 2 stitches just below the centre of the eyes and pull tightly to create the nose. Sew neatly inside the body so that no thread is visible. Using pink yarn, make 2 stitches just below the nose to create the mouth. You can give the doll different facial expressions by where you choose to place the mouth.</p>\n<h3>Runner&#8217;s outfit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/knitting-patterns/toys-to-knit/Olympic-knitting-knit-runner-free-knitting-pattern-template\" target=\"_self\">See the templates on the next page</a></p>\n<p><strong>Vest</strong><br />Cut 2 vest shapes using the template on the following page. Sew both side seams using a neat running stitch. Sew the front right shoulder strap to the back shoulder strap directly behind it. Repeat on the left side. Turn the vest inside out so that no seams show on the outside. Sew all edges under by 0.5cm (&#188;in) using a neat running stitch in a contrasting coloured thread. This adds a little detail to an otherwise plain vest.</p>\n<p><strong>Number</strong><br />Print a number onto paper using your computer (you can write it if you prefer) and cut round it in a square. Attach it to the vest by making small stitches in each corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Shorts</strong><br />Cut 4 shorts shapes using the template on the following page. Sew the bottom and side edges under using a neat running stitch in a contrasting coloured thread. Repeat on all 4 sides. Place the front left leg piece on top of the corresponding back leg piece and repeat with the right leg pieces. Sew both inside seams using a neat running stitch to join the front leg pieces to the corresponding back leg pieces. Sew the front seam to join the 2 front pieces together, then repeat to join the back pieces. Ensure the seams are on the inside. Overlap the front side on the back side by about 1cm (&#189;in) and pin it in place. Repeat for the other side. This creates the overlapped look that running shorts have. Sew around the top of the shorts using a neat running stitch to neaten the edge, ensuring the folded down edge is on the inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Shoes</strong><br />Cut 2 shoe backs, 2 soles and 2 shoe fronts using the templates on the following pages. Sew the bottom of the 2 shoe backs to the back edge of both soles using a neat running stitch in contrasting thread. Wrap the front pieces around the front sections of the sole and sew it securely. Cut up 6 small pieces of ribbon for each shoe. Sew 3 to each side to add detail. This also attaches the front section of the shoe to the back making it less likely to fall off. Thread a sharp needle with white yarn and stitch up the front of the shoe to give the appearance of laces. Tie with a bow at the top.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/IU/PR-The-Olymppknits-book-cover-200sq.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" />This pattern is taken from 'Olympknits' by Laura Long (David &amp; Charles, &#163;6.99). <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781446302323\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy 'Olympknits' from Allaboutyou's online bookshop</a><br /></strong></p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/knitting-patterns/toys-to-knit/Olympic-knitting-knit-gymnast-free-knitting-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Knit an Olympic gymnast: free pattern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/knitting-patterns/toys-to-knit/\" target=\"_blank\">Find more free toy knitting patterns</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/knitting/learn-how-to-knit-knitting-videos\" target=\"_blank\">Need to learn how to knit?

The Hall of Fame trainer knew his charge Bodemeister lost the May 5 Kentucky Derby a half-mile into the mile-and-a-quarter race. \"When I saw the half in 45 seconds I said, 'This is ridiculous. This is not going to happen.' \" Baffert said. \"I was just watching it as a fan from there on.\" He hopes his colt can reserve some energy for the latter stages of Saturday's $1 million Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course, leg two of thoroughbred racings Triple Crown series. The :45.39 half-mile was one of the fastest ever in the history of the Derby, yet instead of stopping, Bodemeister kept fighting. \"When he cut the corner still five in front I said, 'Maybe. I don't know' and then at the eighth pole I saw he was showing some signs of weakening at that point and I said, 'You ran your heart out. Don't worry about it.' \" Bodemeister, the 4-1 favorite, was finally reeled in by 15-1 shot I'll Have Another, settling for second, beaten a length and a half. \"If we'd gone the half a little slower, decent fractions, than I would have felt pretty good, but I knew that was going to be tough to overcome,\" said Baffert, who has won the Preakness five times. On Thursday, Bodemeister got acquainted with the Baltimore oval, going to the track for an earlymorning gallop before schooling in the paddock with the horses for the first race . \"It went well,\" Baffert said. \"He looked like he went over the track nice. He seemed pretty cool out there. I didn't see anything out there to make me think any different so, so far, so good.\" Bodemeister's moniker comes from Bafferts 7-year-old son, Bode, who was named after the Olympic gold medal skier. \"He's like his namesake Bode Miller, the trainer said. \"He puts it all out there, but he can't be going too fast, eventually it will take its toll on a horse like that.\" Doug O'Neill, who trains Ill Have Another, is confident that Bodemeister won't be able to steal the second jewel of the Triple Crown on the front end. \"We're still planning of taking advantage of our early foot,\" ONeill said. While I'll Have Another won by rallying from seventh, the 3-year-old took both the Robert Lewis and Santa Anita Derby tracking in second, close to the pace. \"We'll be involved early,\" ONeill promised.  \"Its in (jockey) Marios (Gutierrez) hands and were confident in the way our colt is doing and as long as hes training the way he is, I think well have a big, big chance.\" The Preakness is the shortest of  the Triple Crown races at a mile-and-three-sixteenths, it's a sixteenth of a mile shorter than the Derby, which many think would be an advantage to Bodemeister. Baffert is not anong them. \"It's not going to be, if he goes too fast early,\" Baffert said. \"Thats the whole key. The pace is going to be the key factor. He needs to slow down. He needs to slow down.\" When asked if jockey Mike Smith would be able to rein in Bodemeister, Baffert joked, \"Hopefully, he eats his Wheaties that day. Maybe he might have a shot.\""}],"article_type_name":"News Article","publish_date":"2012-06-17T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":"PREAKMAIN18S_920571","template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"webuser","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":null,"article_type_prefix":"news","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8936283","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1011","last_updated_date":"2012-06-17T00:10:13.000Z","author_id":"8457","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"newsconsortium","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2022-06-17T00:10:13.000Z","origin_site_name":"News Consortium","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.newsconsortium.com/news-preakmain18s_920571-cefc32ecb81011e18322377d90dd2cb5","issue_date":null,"contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Easy, affordable ways to give &#151; and get &#151; joy","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"good housekeeping, random acts of kindness, 50 simple acts of kindness, acts of kindness, cheap gift ideas, good housekeeping gift ideas","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"50 Simple Acts of Kindness","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-06-25T13:57:03.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health/acts-of-kindness","link_text":"50 Simple Acts of Kindness"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/history/good-housekeeping-seal-history","link_text":"The History of the Good Housekeeping Seal"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health/true-kindness-has-no-calories-1007","link_text":"True Kindness Has No Calories"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/celebrity-interviews/valerie-bertinelli","link_text":"What Turning 50 Means for Valerie Bertinelli"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/green-good-housekeeping-seal-directory","link_text":"Green Good Housekeeping Seal Directory"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/anti-aging-skin-product-testing","link_text":"How We Picked the Winners of Good Housekeeping 's First Annual Anti-Aging Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/good-housekeeping-125-anniversary","link_text":"Happy 125th Anniversary, Good Housekeeping !"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/childrens-products/toy-reviews/best-toys-of-2010-honorable-mentions","link_text":"Good Housekeeping's Best Toys of 2010: How We Tested"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/blogs-books/good-housekeeping-bookstore","link_text":"The Good Housekeeping Bookstore"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/holidays/ghk-holiday-gift-ideas","link_text":"Good Housekeeping 's Holiday Gift Ideas"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Katy","source_id":"10","teaser":"Looking for a way to brighten someone's day?

Luckily, you don't have to wait: The benefits of charity and compassion are powerful and immediate. You've seen it on the bus, when someone offers his or her seat to an elderly person: The generous person feels noble, the elderly person beams with gratitude, and even spectators feel like cheering inside just from having witnessed a simple act of kindness. As it turns out, the effects of those experiences aren't just psychological. Those who study the science of do-gooding have discovered that performing (or even just imagining performing) a good deed has major <em>physiological </em>benefits &#151; for the giver, not just the recipient. Naturally, we don't behave in benevolent ways to benefit from our actions...but just between us, the side effects are awesome.</p>\n<p>David R. Hamilton, Ph.D., is a chemist who left a career developing cardiac and cancer drugs to do research that led to studying the health benefits of kindness and happiness. Hamilton says that performing a kind act releases oxytocin &#151; the same brain chemical that surges when you hold your baby or snuggle a dog &#151; which also temporarily lowers blood pressure. \"Kindness is literally good for your heart,\" explains Hamilton.</p>\n<p>Nearly a hundred years ago, aviator Amelia Earhart observed, \"A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.\" Her inspiring words were borne out by the results of a study published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that showed how a single altruistic kidney donation set off a domino effect, resulting in 10 successive transplants.</p>\n<p>Perhaps because tough economic times bring out our neighborly compassion &#151; or because it's an idea that never went away &#151; suddenly kindness feels like it's all around us and more important than ever. Right now, there's a Chicago man performing an act of kindness every day, and blogging about it (at <a href=\"http://www.366randomacts.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> 366randomacts.org</a>),to set a good example for his daughter &#151; sometimes it's as simple as scrubbing the house from top to bottom, which made his wife break down in tears. There's a woman who rings strangers' doorbells and leaves sunflowers on their stoops (<a href=\"http://www.kindnessgirl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kindnessgirl.com</a>); she also scrawls first-day-of-school sidewalk messages that say, \"Don't be shy, we're all new friends!\" And there's a coffee shop in South Carolina where ordinary customers regularly hand over $100 bills with instructions that the cash be used to pay for other customers' coffee until the money runs out. Look closely and you'll see the generosity of everyday people everywhere. All we have to do to change our own lives is pass it on.</p>\n<p>1. Leave a bouquet at the hospital &#151; the nurses will know who needs it the most.</p>\n<p>2. Make a struggling family's summer by buying them a season pass to the municipal pool.</p>\n<p>3. Help a friend see today in a wondrous new light: Hand him or her a kaleidoscope.</p>\n<p>4. If you are in a long line, invite the person behind you to go first.</p>\n<p>5. Shower the pediatric wing of a hospital with $1 coloring books and $2 boxes of new crayons.</p>\n<p>6. Hang a sign on a bulletin board that says \"Take What You Need\" &#151; with tear-off tabs at the bottom for Love, Hope, Faith, and Courage.</p>\n<p>7. Bring courtesy back in an instant: Hold the door open with a flourish.</p>\n<p>8. Drop off combs, toothbrushes, and toothpaste at a shelter or a soup kitchen.</p>\n<p>9. Curb road rage: Let other cars merge onto the highway.</p>\n<p>10. Leave your neighbors a note that tells them how much joy you find in admiring their garden.</p>\n<p>11. Put sticky notes with positive messages (e.g., \"You look gorgeous!\") on a restroom mirror.</p>\n<p>12. In low-income families, a baby can spend a day or longer in the same diaper, and laundromats often don't allow cloth diapers to be washed in machines. Help out a mom and a baby by donating diapers (find a directory of diaper banks at <a href=\"http://www.diaperbanknetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">diaperbanknetwork.org</a>).<em> </em></p>\n<p>13. Send a thank-you note to the brave officers at your local police station. (Given how we carry on about parking tickets, it's important to acknowledge the daily risks taken by the men and women on the force.)</p>\n<p>14. Share the wealth: Ask the grocery clerk to apply your unused coupons to another customer's items.</p>\n<p>15. Arrange to pay anonymously for a soldier's breakfast when you see him or her dining alone.</p>\n<p>16. Slip a $20 gas card or public-transportation pass into someone's shopping bag.</p>\n<p>17. Rekindle your Girl Scout spirit: Pick up trash at a park or a playground.</p>\n<p>18. Donate your old professional clothes to an organization, like Dress for Success (<a href=\"http://www.dressforsuccess.org/\" target=\"_blank\">dressforsuccess.org</a>), that helps women jump-start their careers &#151; and up their confidence.</p>\n<p>19. Carry someone's groceries.</p>\n<p>20. It's hot out! Offer your mail carrier a glass of iced tea or a $5 Starbucks gift card.</p>\n<p>21. Bake bread or cookies and deliver the food to a nearby fire station or group home.</p>\n<p>22. Be the bigger person: Cede the parking space.</p>\n<p>23. Check \"yes\" when asked if you wish to become an organ donor &#151; and tell your family.</p>\n<p>24. Lay your neighbors' newspaper at their front door along with a plate of blueberry muffins</p>\n<p>25. Donate old cell phones to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (<a href=\"http://www.ncadv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ncadv.org</a>), which will use the proceeds for programs that protect families from abuse.</p>\n<p>26. Sing an employee's praises to a manager or on a comment card &#151; a little recognition goes a long way.</p>\n<p>27. Share happy memories. Stick an old photo in the mail to a friend and write a note about the day it was taken on the back.</p>\n<p>28. Send an ooey-gooey dessert over to another table at a restaurant.</p>\n<p>29. Leave a copy of a book you love, with a note for the next reader, on the train or the bus.</p>\n<p>30. Send valentines in August.</p>\n<p>31. Load extra change into the vending machine to buy the next person a Coke.<em> </em></p>\n<p>32. Send somebody an e-card, just because. The funnier, the better.</p>\n<p>33. Name a star after someone (<a href=\"http://www.starregistry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">starregistry.com</a>).</p>\n<p>34. Forgive someone. Repeat as necessary.</p>\n<p>35. Resolve to refrain from negative self-talk (you deserve your kindness, too!).</p>\n<p>36. On trash day, wheel your neighbor's can out to the curb.</p>\n<p>37. Relay an overheard compliment.</p>\n<p>38. You don't have to send every disadvantaged child to college, but you can buy one of them a life-changing book: Try <a href=\"http://www.booksforkids.org/\" target=\"_blank\">booksforkids.org</a>.</p>\n<p>39. To melt away her blues, send a friend a funny video from YouTube.</p>\n<p>40. Volunteer to read to kids at an after-school program.</p>\n<p>41. Give your mom a shout-out on your birthday &#151; after all, she deserves some credit for your life.</p>\n<p>42. Pause and give people the benefit of the doubt. E-mail, especially, can cause unintentional feather-ruffling.</p>\n<p>43. Bring your spouse coffee in bed.</p>\n<p>44. Treat an elderly neighbor, with a gift certificate, to a $30 pedicure. Bonus points if you can do so anonymously.</p>\n<p>45. Dedi-cate a song on the radio to someone you know is listening during his or her long commute.</p>\n<p>46. Take kindness on the road: Pay thetoll for the car behind you.</p>\n<p>47. Slow way down when you drive past a pedestrian &#151; 35 mph can seem like the Indy 500 to a woman walking her dog.</p>\n<p>48. Rescue a wallflower! Strike up a conversation with someone who's standing alone at a party.</p>\n<p>49. Leave extra umbrellas in vestibules with notes that say \"Use this to stay dry!\"</p>\n<p>50. Ask others &#151; sincerely &#151; what you can do to help.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-15T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1516504","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/5i/0712-coffee-cup-flowers-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"McColl","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8964539","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

dinner diary. What drives a person to write down what she cooks or eats for dinner every night in a blank book? And to do this every night for 14 years and counting? The rationale I like best is this: It always bothered me that my husband, Andy, and I would spend so many of our waking hours planning for dinner only to have all traces of that meal disappear forever in 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>When we were first married, I can remember on more than one occasion opening my eyes in bed on a Sunday morning and seeing my new husband staring right back at me, wide awake.</p>\n<p>The first thing he'd say was not \"Good morning\" or \"How did you sleep?\" It was \"What should we do for dinner tonight?\" Then the rest of the day would seem to head in one direction: the meal. Writing down what that meal was made the effort and the event itself seem less fleeting and more meaningful. Or maybe that's just what I tell myself.</p>\n<p>But on Sunday, February 22, 1998, the very first date written on the very first page of my dinner diary, I didn't care about theories. I had one thing on my mind when I opened up the blank green book Andy had bought me for the previous Christmas: <em>How do I make dinner happen?</em> How could I ensure that I would never again have to endure the agonizing back-and-forth weeknight e-mail exchange that would begin around five o'clock and usually went something like this:</p>\n<p><strong>HIM:</strong><em> What should we do for dinner?</em></p>\n<p><strong>ME:</strong><em> I don't know. What do you think?</em></p>\n<p><strong>HIM: </strong><em>I don't know. What are you in the mood for?</em></p>\n<p><strong>ME:</strong><em> Something healthy? Salad?</em></p>\n<p><strong>HIM: </strong><em>Just had a big salad for lunch. Pasta?</em></p>\n<p><strong>ME:</strong><em> Nah, Jennifer Aniston lost 30 pounds by not eating pasta.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HIM: </strong><em>Well, what, then?</em></p>\n<p><strong>ME:</strong><em> I don't know.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HIM: </strong><em>Sweet.</em></p>\n<p>When, by some miracle, we did decide on a meal, we'd usually have to cram in an express stop at the supermarket on our way home &#151; and since we were in our mid-20s and therefore never leaving work before our bosses left, that meant we weren't home until after eight o'clock, by which point we'd be starving and opt for 10-minute spaghetti with Rag&#249; Robusto instead of 30-minute ditalini with <em>amatriciana</em> sauce or whatever recipe had sounded good when we had flipped through <em>Food & Wine</em> at the beach a few days earlier. Adding to the stress, I had no confidence in the kitchen, no confidence in my improvisational abilities. I had not yet trained myself to look at a lone onion and envision Spaghetti and Caramelized Onions. I had not learned that I wasn't going to be arrested if a recipe called for smoked paprika and I had only the regular kind. I was a recipe girl; I liked to follow them to the letter.</p>\n<p>So on that Sunday in February, in an attempt to preempt all this dinner angst, I wrote down a lineup of everything I wanted to cook that week on the first page of my blank book. Then we drew up a shopping list based on that lineup and hit the supermarket. It wasn't sexy and it wasn't necessarily original, but our plan-in-advance system worked. The day we started doing this was the day cooking and eating together started resembling the meals I grew up with, dinners that were relaxing and satisfying. So what if I had to put up with friend after friend picking up my diary from the kitchen counter and, after realizing what it was, asking, \"Jenny? Is everything OK?\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062080903/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=goodhousekeeping-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062080903\"

All finished with potty training? Retired those gnawed sippy cups to the &#147;sippy cup fairy?&#148; If you&#146;re no longer saying &#147;and this is why we can&#146;t have nice things&#148; on a daily basis, it might be time to reevaluate some things around the house.</p>\n<p>We&#146;re just breaking into that point, and I realized recently that my home furnishings have become like the diaper bag I just <em>finally</em> ditched: tired-looking and several years out of date. It&#146;s nothing terrible; the towels just don&#146;t look as fresh as they did, say, a decade ago. The sheets have suffered through nighttime diaper leaks. And I think the kids are ready to make the big leap away from plastic dinnerware. It&#146;s time for the house to grow up, and I&#146;m starting by putting those over-used plastic dishes in the recycling bin. &#160;</p>\n<p>Now that we&#146;re not limited to sippy cups and plates with bunnies on them, I&#146;m ready for something sharp and classic that&#146;s not stuffy. I&#146;m getting my home-decorating groove back with the mix-and-match black and white designs of Martha Stewart&#146;s <a href=\"http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/martha-stewart-collection-dinnerware-lisbon-geneva-banded-mix-match-collections?ID=571678&CategoryID=42353#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D17%26ruleId%3D52%26slotId%3D\">Geneva, Lisbon, and black-banded dishes</a>. They strike the perfect balance of sophisticated without being stuffy or too formal for a family dinner table.</p>\n<p>Speaking of dinner tables, it&#146;s time to make that a haven again. Yes, it&#146;s a place to do homework, fold laundry, and sort mail. But it&#146;s also a place to come together as a family at the end of a busy day. As my kids get older, it&#146;s becoming easier and easier to let that dinnertime slip away. Meetings, sports, and activities pull us in different directions. But isn&#146;t that prime time re-stake your claim on family dinnertime?</p>\n<p>Studies consistently show that having a family dinner together is one of the single best things parents can do for their kids. Freshening things up &#150; getting rid of the scratched plastic ducky plates, clearing off the laundry and mail, maybe even putting down (<em>gasp!</em>) cloth napkins&#151;let my family know that dinnertime is a priority.</p>\n<p>Plus, as my kids have fewer play dates and more, um, actual dates (wait, when did that happen?), I want them to <em>want</em> to have their friends over. To put it simply, I&#146;d rather have my kids and their friends <em>here</em> so I know what they&#146;re up to. I have the feeling that maybe the &#147;kid dishes&#148; aren&#146;t quite going to cut it.</p>\n<p>Starting over with cool new &#147;grown-up&#148; dishes sends a signal to my family: I see the kids are growing up, and they&#146;re ready for real plates. It also shows them that dinnertime is important to us as a family, and I&#146;m setting a table they can be proud to bring friends to. And most importantly, it tells them this: I&#146;m reclaiming the family dinner table for actual family dinners.</p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-06-14T16:21:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":null,"source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kmmdhd","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9118889","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2012-07-06T22:36:26.000Z","author_id":"2996","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-24T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/kids-family/blogs/mom-blog/family-dinner-table","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The season's most powerful statement shoes are not only crafted by some of the world's top artisans, they also improve lives.","site_id":"21","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"afeuer","keywords":"pikolinos designer fashion, massai fashion, pikolinos feel-good fashion","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Fashion Gives Back: Every Little Step","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-06-13T15:00:04.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Katie L.","source_id":"10","teaser":"The season's most powerful statement shoes are not only crafted by some of the world's top artisans, they also improve lives.","origin_site_id":"21","sub_heading":"The season's most powerful statement shoes are not only crafted by some of the world's top artisans, they also improve lives.","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"The season's most powerful statement shoes are not only crafted by some of the world's top artisans, they also improve lives.","url_name":"pikolinos-massai-fashion","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-05-27T04:11:18.000Z","title":"Fashion Gives Back: Every Little Step","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Pikolinos Feel-Good Fashion - Pikolinos Massai Fashion","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"21","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"aparrish","last_name":"Connor","email":null,"creation_date":"2009-06-22T22:15:15.000Z","id":"8537","last_updated_date":"2009-06-22T22:15:15.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Katie L."},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<p>Few things have more impact than a Maasai tribeswoman in full regalia. Her multicolored breastplates and bracelets are so striking that designers can't help but find inspiration in their densely beaded glory. (Proenza Schouler, Vionnet, and Burberry come to mind.) Where many might see a mere trend, the Spain-based accessories label Pikolinos saw an opportunity to provide a steady income to Maasai women &#151; whose small earnings from hawking their wares to tourists are unreliable at best. The eco-conscious Pikolinos, which made its U.S. debut in May, employs more than 1,000 women of Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve to craft intricate details for its aptly named Maasai Collection. \"It's amazing,\" says model Eugenia Silva, who spent a week with the tribe and stars in the new ad campaign. \"Pikolinos has the best leathers and workers in Spain, yet for this project they came to Kenya to give women a salary to buy a cow and send their children to school.\" And the do-gooding doesn't stop there. All profits from the collection go to the development of health and education centers in the Maasai community. So go ahead, try walking in their shoes.</p>\n<p><strong>Shoes</strong>, $180-$210, Pikolinos; <a href=\"http://www.pikolinos.com/\"

The portrait was Maura's idea, something memorable for their mother's 67th birthday. But as usual, Kath wants to take the whole thing over.</p>\n<p>\"I was thinking we could use Carter's backyard,\" Maura says. Carter, Maura's boyfriend, or significant other, or whatever he is, rents the bottom half of an old house near downtown, and his backyard has gravel paths, a fountain, and massive old rhododendrons at the far edges. It's an elegant garden left over from long ago.</p>\n<p>\"Carter's not part of our family,\" Kath says.</p>\n<p>\"Close enough,\" Maura says.</p>\n<p>\"It'll just confuse Mom. She'll look at the picture and wonder, <em>Who's that guy standing next to Maura, and where's Webb?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom knows perfectly well who Carter is.\" Maura draws a slow breath. She doesn't want to start a fight in the Sandwich Depot, but Kath always exaggerates, twisting reality to make her worries sound more reasonable. \"And Mom won't be looking for Webb. It's been five years, Kath. Webb has a whole other family now. Why don't we include Webb and Marissa and the baby in our picture, and see if <em>that</em> confuses Mom?\"</p>\n<p>\"Three times,\" Kath says, ignoring Maura's sarcasm. \"That's three times that I know of.\" According to Kath, their mom has been calling out friendly hellos to strangers. \"Like when she came with us to the science museum,\" Kath says. \"She's greeting people inappropriately, and she doesn't even realize it. You'd see it, too, if you spent more time with her.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see her as much as you do,\" Maura says. Of course she's noticed Mom's blips of forgetfulness, but they seem like normal blips. Heck, Maura forgets things, too; two nights ago she left the hose running so that by morning her side yard had turned into a muddy pond. But she hasn't seen any inappropriate greetings. That's just Kath, exaggerating as usual.</p>\n<p>Kath picks up her phone, tapping her calendar open. \"Mom has an appointment with the endocrinologist coming up. Would you &#151;\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll take her,\" Maura says, before Kath can start in on how worried she is about Mom's prediabetes and how, with that on top of her memory loss, it probably isn't safe for her to leave the house alone.</p>\n<p>\"That would be great,\" Kath says. \"I'll call the photographer.\"</p>\n<p>A few nights later, Mom enters Maura's little kitchen exclaiming over her granddaughter's stellar driving skills. Ellie, Maura's older daughter, got her license two weeks ago, and tonight she drove to the South End and fetched her grandmother. Ellie beams at her grandmother, showing her dimples and flipping her long hair, then disappears upstairs.</p>\n<p>Maura's two daughters are so pretty, with their green eyes, glossy hair, and beautiful skin, and she wonders how this can be, since she was a frizzy-haired, slouchy mess through her teens.</p>\n<p>Now Mom sets a quart jug of maple syrup on the counter and frowns at it.</p>\n<p>\"What's with the syrup, and why now?\" Maura asks, mixing salad for their cookout.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, someone brought it to me, someone whose family has a sugar house, oh, you know....\" She pauses, then lets out a sigh.</p>\n<p>\"Well, thanks,\" Maura says. \"You must mean Lydia Thompson, right?\" Mom's friend Lydia grew up in the North Country, and Lydia's brothers still run a commercial sugaring operation up there.</p>\n<p>\"Right, of course.\" Mom smacks her palm against her forehead. Her coral lipstick bleeds into the fine tracery of lines above her lip.</p>\n<p>If Kath were here, she'd grab her lipliner pencil, then walk Mom to the bathroom to show her how to use it, but Maura knows when to leave well enough alone, and she hands Mom a glass of wine. \"I got some wild salmon on special, and Carter's out back getting the grill ready.\" She keeps her eyes on Mom, to see if Carter's name confuses her. But Mom only smiles, eyebrows raised in anticipation.</p>\n<p>\"Well, how fancy,\" she says. \"I'll go tell him hello.\" She trundles out the back door to the deck.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-14T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1415426","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/lb/0712-story-winner-sarah-mccraw-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"10","author_last_name":"McCraw Crow","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8964533","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/short-fiction-time-lapse\">GH's Fiction Contest Winner : Time Lapse </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sweeps/fiction-contest-official-rules\">2011 Good Housekeeping Fiction Contest </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/inspirational-people/short-fiction-stories-at-the-pond\">GH's Fiction Story Contest Runner-Up: At the Pond</a><br>\n<a href=\"/online-sweepstakes/good-housekeepings-nail-breast-cancer-contest-official-rules\">Good Housekeeping's Nail Breast Cancer Contest - Official Rules</a><br>\n<a href=\"/contest-rules-family-holiday-decorating-tradition\">Contest Rules: Your Family's Favorite Holiday Decorating Tradition</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sweeps/fiction-contest\">Good Housekeeping 's Short Story Contest </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/sheryl-crow-interview\">Sheryl Crow on Motherhood</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/books-historical-fiction-art-may07\">Our Favorite Historical Fiction /Art Novels</a><br>\n<a href=\"/recipes/cook-your-heart-out-contest-recipe-guidelines\">Good Housekeeping 's Cook Your Heart Out Contest Recipe Guidelines</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/mr-good-housekeeping-0706\">Meet Mr. Good Housekeeping !</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-07-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:41:53.000Z","author_id":"69049","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/blogs-books/short-fiction-time-lapse","issue_date":"July 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"It's a sad-but-true fact of parenthood: Dad often always plays second fiddle to Mom &#133; even Father's Day is No. 2 in line.

But many remarks and questions make these families uncomfortable, even if you don&#146;t mean to be intrusive. &#147;People unfamiliar with adoption may think they&#146;re showing interest or support by asking questions,&#148; says adoption educator Ellen Singer, a licensed certified clinical social worker with the <a href=\"http://www.adoptionsupport.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Adoption Support and Education</a> in Burtonsville, MD. &#147;But some comments can be upsetting or damaging to families.&#148; Here are the top eight things you should avoid bringing up, what you can say instead and when to keep quiet.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Which one is your real child?</strong></p>\n<p>This question is a button-pusher for many families with both adoptive and biological children. &#147;Every child in the family <em>is</em> their child,&#148; says Amanda Baden, PhD, a licensed psychologist specializing in adoption in New York City and associate professor at Montclair State University in Montclair, NJ. &#147;This question sends the message that the only authentic way to form a family is biologically.&#148; Not that it&#146;s appropriate to ask if the adopted child isn&#146;t present, but it&#146;s worse if you ask in front of her; the comment makes it sound as if she&#146;s less important than the other family members. &#147;The term &#145;real&#146; is absurd, as if my daughter is a &#145;pretend&#146; or &#145;fake&#146; child,&#148; says Marilys Scheindel, a mom of two in Maine. The experts agree: Stay away from this question, no matter how curious you are.</p>\n<p><strong>2. He&#146;s so lucky to have been adopted by you.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you&#146;re trying to compliment an adoptive parent, you&#146;re implying she &#147;rescued&#148; the child or that adoption is an act of charity, says Singer. The statement also discounts what the child&#146;s given up. &#147;Adoption involves loss,&#148; says Megan Terry, a mom of three who blogs about adoption at <a href=\"http://www.millionsofmiles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Millions of Miles</a>. &#147;It&#146;s the loss of the child&#146;s first family, familiar surroundings, rituals, routines and often the birth country, culture and language. To say he&#146;s &#145;lucky&#146; invalidates his experiences and feelings.&#148; A better approach: Say something like, &#147;What a wonderful family you are,&#148; says family therapist Leigh Leslie, PhD, associate professor at the University of Maryland in College Park and a researcher in transracial adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How much did it cost to adopt?</strong></p>\n<p>People often ask this insensitive question, which makes parents cringe. &#147;It sounds like you&#146;re referring to the child as a purchase,&#148; says Dr. Baden. In addition, it&#146;s incredibly invasive. &#147;Yes, there are fees associated with adoption, as there are with childbirth,&#148; notes Alison Noyce, a mom of four who blogs about adoption at <a href=\"http://www.theyreallmyown.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">They&#146;re All My Own</a>. &#147;Besides, this information is available on the Internet.&#148; If you&#146;re considering adopting, ask, &#147;Can you please refer me to organizations or classes where we can learn more about adoption?&#148; instead of requesting personal financial details. If you&#146;re not looking into adoption, steer clear of this question altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>4. You&#146;ll probably get pregnant now that you&#146;ve adopted.</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, &#147;The comment makes it seem as if this child is not as valuable as a biological child or that the family is somehow &#145;settling&#146; for this child,&#148; says Dr. Leslie. Secondly, it assumes all families adopt due to infertility issues, which isn&#146;t at all the case. Instead of speaking about the child as if she&#146;s second-best, celebrate the joy the family feels about having a new family member. A simple &#147;Congratulations!&#148; is all that&#146;s necessary. <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>5. Why was she given up?</strong></p>\n<p>This question has many variations, including &#147;What do you know about her background?&#148; or &#147;What happened to his birth mom?&#148; In any form, they&#146;re intensely personal and usually not something families wish to share with anyone. &#147;Think of it as similar to being asked in what position you conceived your child,&#148; says Dr. Baden. Plus, there&#146;s a chance the family doesn&#146;t know the answer to your question, and asking them puts them in an awkward position. Bottom line: &#147;This is not one to ask, ever,&#148; says Terry. &#147;It&#146;s my son&#146;s story, not mine. We shouldn&#146;t expect children&#146;s stories to be a matter of public record.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are your children siblings?</strong></p>\n<p>The unspoken message is that there&#146;s a difference between adoptive and biological siblings, says Dr. Leslie. &#147;My kids are obviously brother and sister because we adopted them both,&#148; says Scheindel. Another reason not to ask this: Again, the child&#146;s background is his or her story and doesn&#146;t have to be shared with everyone. Instead of concentrating on a topic that&#146;s truly not your business, offer a genuine compliment such as, &#147;Your children are so well-mannered.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>7. What if she searches for her real parents?</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;This kind of question perpetuates the myth that adoptive families are only &#145;babysitting&#146; until their children locate their biological parents,&#148; says Singer. It also reveals a misunderstanding about adoption today&#151;it&#146;s not the closed system it was in decades past. &#147;Many people don&#146;t realize that the days are gone when families wouldn&#146;t tell a child she was adopted, as if it were something to be ashamed of,&#148; says Terry. Though there&#146;s less of a stigma about being adopted, it&#146;s still best to avoid this question, say the experts.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Why did you choose international adoption when there are so many kids who need homes here?</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Asking parents to justify how a beloved child came to be theirs is hurtful,&#148; says Noyce. &#147;There are children all over the world who need families. No child is more deserving of a family than another, regardless of where he or she was born.&#148; Avoid these judgmental remarks, and focus on the happiness the child brings, rather than her birthplace. If you&#146;d like to show support to a close friend who&#146;s adopted internationally, Terry suggests checking out books and websites about the child&#146;s birth country, if the parents have shared

To keep ultrabooks slim, manufacturers typically laminate LCD screens in place without a glossy protective top layer.    \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Q3/ultrabook-02-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>2  Battery </b>Open an ultrabook and you'll see that half the real estate is occupied by a battery. These PCs can run 5 to 7 hours on a charge&#151;accept nothing less.    \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/SA/ultrabook-03-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>3 Unibody chassis  </b>When you build something this thin, rigidity becomes an issue. Look for a firm metal (aluminum or magnesium) structure. Avoid plastic chassis, which can bend or break. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>4 Ports  </b>Prepare to make do with fewer of these. Ultrabooks have no optical drive and rarely more than two USBs (make sure at least one is USB 3.0), plus an SD card reader. At the 11-inch size, you often lose the SD, too. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>5  Wi-Fi </b>Unless you want to carry around a USB or proprietary Ethernet dongle, the built-in Wi-Fi card is your only path to the Internet&#151;most ultrabooks have no built-in Ethernet jack.     \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/LG/ultrabook-04-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>6  CPU </b>   The ultrabook's secret ingredient is a low-power processor with integrated graphics. Newer PCs should be using Intel's Ivy Bridge CPUs, which stretch battery life and improve video performance.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>7  RAM</b> In a typical computer, RAM is the most user-upgradable part. Not in ultrabooks. The RAM is soldered to the motherboard, so plan for the future by buying a machine with at least 4 GB. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>8  Hard Drive  </b> Most ultrabooks use solid-state drives (SSDs) in the new mSATA format&#151;essentially, that's a small circuit board with flash memory on it. SSDs are speedy, but capacity is low.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Open Format Article","publish_date":"2012-06-12T18:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11119","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Derene and Anthony Verducci","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9077294","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4287292\">Why Apple's New MacBook Pros Represent the Future of Mobile Computing</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4244943\">Apple MacBook Air Hands-on: Live @ MacWorld 2008 (With Pix)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/news/4243000\">MacBook Touch Mockup: Is This Apple's Top-Secret Laptop?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4285615\">How to Pump up the Volume on Your MacBook's Quiet Speakers</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/news/wwdc-apple-brings-retina-display-and-solid-state-drives-to-macbook-pro-9622691\">WWDC: Apple Brings Retina Display and Solid-State Drives to MacBook Pro</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/macbook-air-snap-judgment-review\">Snap Judgment on the New MacBook Air </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/macbook-air-unboxed-pictures\">The New MacBook Air , Unboxed: Pictures</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/tests/4258725\">Mac vs. PC : The Ultimate Lab Test for New Desktops &amp; Laptops </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/the-rise-of-the-ultrabook-ces-analysis-6636800\">The Rise of the Ultrabook: CES Analysis</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/so-you-want-to-buy-an-ultrabook-heres-whats-inside-9077294\">So You Want to Buy an Ultrabook?

So not hearing back within a day is a cause for concern, but it certainly doesn&#146;t mean it&#146;s curtains.</p>\n<p><strong>3 days</strong> A recent survey by Harris Interactive found that 50 emails a day is the limit before people become overloaded. &#147;A slow response is a bad sign only if she doesn&#146;t offer an explanation,&#148; says professor of communications at Univeristy of Texas, Dawna Ballard. </p>\n<p><strong>Your timely fix</strong> &#147;Because there are so many platforms for conversation, it&#146;s impossible to keep a constant watch on all of them,&#148; says Kalman. Identify her preferred method &#150; email, Facebook, text, phone or Twitter &#150; then shift at least 75% of your weight of communication exclusively there. </p>\n\n<h2>How late is she for the first date? </h2>\n<p><strong>5-10 minutes</strong> &#147;Women are typically up to 10 minutes late for first dates,&#148; says communications analyst at York University, Dr Peter Bull. Be pleased if she sticks to this. But be warned: if she&#146;s early, she could be &#147;task-oriented&#148; and view dates as if they were business meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>25-25 minutes</strong> If she&#146;s more than 25 minutes late without a good excuse, watch out. &#147;She might offer a genuine apology, but if she gives no advance notice or brushes it off, you should invest your time elsewhere,&#148; says Bull.</p>\n<p><strong>Your timely fix</strong> By putting her at ease upon arrival, you&#146;ll create momentum. &#147;Bring a book about a hobby you love,&#148; says counselling psychologist Dr Soren Stauffer-Kruse. &#147;Reading makes you look relaxed and sparks conversation.&#148;</p>\n\n<h2>She holds your gaze for...</h2>\n<p><strong>5-10 seconds</strong> Eye contact provides a&#160;valuable feedback tool. &#147;If she holds your gaze while you are speaking, this shows real interest,&#148; says Bull. &#147;However, maintaining eye contact while she is speaking simply shows that she feels secure in herself.&#148; Don&#146;t confuse the two.</p>\n<p><strong>>10 seconds</strong> Believe it or not, too much eye contact is a bad thing. &#147;Uncomfortably long looks are associated with confrontation,&#148; says Bull. If her eyes significantly exceed the natural 5-10 seconds period, she&#146;s likely to be showing disdain or disapproval, even if this is unconscious on her part.</p>\n<p><strong>Your timely fix</strong> Choose quiet date locations. &#147;Pubs and bars with TVs or jukeboxes present a challenge for early dates because distractions are rife,&#148; says Ballard. Pick a quiet corner and sit facing the bar. She&#146;ll naturally take the seat opposite, with less in her eye line to distract her.</p>\n\n<h2>The goodbye takes...</h2>\n<p><strong>3-5 minutes</strong> Lingering for more than 3 minutes after the two of you leave the venue, shows she&#146;s seriously interested. &#147;If she sees potential she&#146;ll use this time to establish more of a&#160;bond,&#148; says Ballard. </p>\n<p><strong><60 seconds</strong> A swift exit is a warning. &#147;In particular, using work as an excuse for a quick getaway is an extremely bad sign,&#148; says Bull. She&#146;s either playing hard to get... or impossible to get.</p>\n<p><strong>Your timely fix</strong> &#147;Wait before arranging another date,&#148; says Stauffer-Kruse. Not knowing what&#146;s going to happen next will raise her levels of anticipation and allow her to reflect on the last date. Your golden window is two days.</p>\n\n<h2>Her text message...</h2>\n<p><strong>Reply <1 hour</strong> &#147;A quick response shows she&#146;s open to an exchange of messages,&#148; says Kalman. But don&#146;t worry if she leaves it a couple hours. &#147;She&#146;ll always reply within two to three hours if she&#146;s genuinely interested.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>3 late replies</strong> &#147;Don&#146;t judge her behaviour following one late or non-existent reply,&#148; says Ballard. &#147;But if she fails to reply to your texts within three hours on three consecutive occasions, she&#146;s moved on.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Your timely fix</strong> A Cornell University study found that positive energy peaks after 4pm, so slip into her mind with a late afternoon text, when she&#146;ll be at her most receptive.</p>\n\n<p><em><font size=\"1\">Words: Brittany Kennedy</font></em></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-06-12T06:31:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8865666","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/sex/100-days-of-sex\">100 days of sex</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/mh-investigates-ecstasy\">MH investigates: Ecstasy</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/eliminate-first-date-fear-240665\">Eliminate first date fear</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/4-steps-to-get-her-number-today-516196\">4 steps to get her number today</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/read-her-sex-sign-language-300070\">Read her sex sign language</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/make-her-a-sexual-thrill-seeker\">Seven ways to get more adventurous sex</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/reduce-her-inhibitions\">Tease out her wild side</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/rapid-response-254710\">Rapid response</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/how-to-read-her-facial-expressions-338361\">How to read her facial expressions</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/mens-health-dating/read-her-body-10108\">Read her body</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"june '12 p35","print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:35:43.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-15T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/please-woman/clock-her-signals","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Cooking tip of the week","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"baking, cooking tips, baking tips, good housekeeping tips, tips, eggs and baking, eggs, eggs room temperature, good housekeeping recipes, egg recipes","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Cooking tip of the week","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-09T11:01:21.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"635","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Seriously useful baking know-how","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"allaboutyou.com brings you cooking tips from Good Housekeeping including this one about using eggs at room temperature for baking. allaboutyou.com - the online home of Good Housekeeping, Prima, Country Living, Coast and House Beautiful","url_name":"cooking-tips-good-housekeeping-baking-eggs-room-temperature","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-05-03T14:30:48.000Z","title":"Cooking tip of the week","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"cooking-tips-good-housekeeping-baking-eggs-room-temperature","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"505","active":"Y","site_id":"601","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"sragan","last_name":"Unknown","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-02-22T14:18:55.000Z","id":"11239","last_updated_date":"2011-02-22T14:18:55.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Unknown"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<p>For most baking, eggs should be used at room temperature.

in</h2>\n<p>Lunch is the healthy-minded man&#146;s downfall. There&#146;s no time to cook. The superfood salad at the nearby cafe offends both your palette and wallet. And so the cheap, calorific, coronary-inducing sandwich gets sleepwalked to the checkout once again. Plus, unless you grab a packet of crisps and a Twix, you won&#146;t be full, right?</p>\n<p>So it goes: for the fifth Monday in a row, your virtuous nutritional vows don&#146;t make it beyond noon. But it need not be this way. What if you could get all your lunches for the week prepped in a single weekend cooking session?</p>\n<p>In this new series, <em>MH</em> reveals how to prepare a perfect hunk of meat over the weekend, then use it as the base for five deliciously different lunches for every day of your working week. Get your smug face ready for envious colleagues. First up: pork.</p>\n<h2>Go the whole hog</h2>\n<p>Knocking up tasty swine isn&#146;t easy. Over-cooking, which leaves the meat dry and leathery, is the norm for those not armed with perfect culinary timing and an instant-read thermometer. Under-cooking, meanwhile, can leave your body with complaints far more serious than betrayed taste buds. (Though it&#146;s worth noting that, provided you&#146;ve sourced good quality pork, a rosy tinge to the meat won&#146;t do your stomach any harm.)</p>\n<p>The solution? Stick the joint in the oven all day and all night. Cooking the meat for 24 hours might seem ludicrous, but it&#146;s very simple, requires no attention and leaves you with perfect, moist pork every time. You&#146;ll need a relatively large joint &#150; a half or whole shoulder, bone in &#150; which will ensure you can feed a group for Sunday lunch and still have enough meat to cover your midday meals for the rest of the week. After pigging out, wrap the meat in clingfilm, place in the fridge and it&#146;ll easily keep until Friday.</p>\n<h2>Master recipe</h2>\n<p><strong>Prep time</strong> 10 mins <br /><strong>Cooking time</strong> 24 hours</p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<p>1 whole shoulder of pork (bone in), approx 5-8kg</p>\n<p><strong>For the rub</strong> <br />1 tbsp fish sauce <br />1 tbsp ginger <br />1 fresh red chilli or a large pinch of dried <br />1 tsp fennel seeds <br />Juice of 1 lime or half a lemon <br />1 tbsp brown or palm sugar <br />1 star anise <br />1 cinnamon stick <br />1 tbsp flavourless oil such as vegetable or sunflower <br />3 cloves garlic <br />1 tsp black pepper</p>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p>1. Score the skin of the pork with a Stanley knife (or ask your butcher to do this for you) with lines about 1cm apart.</p>\n<p>2. Blend the ingredients for the rub until smooth. You may want to grind the dry ingredients up first in a pestle and mortar before liquidising everything together.</p>\n<p>3. Pre-heat the oven to its highest setting. Place the pork on a rack over a roasting tin (you can actually do this directly on the shelf in the oven if you haven&#146;t got a rack). Really rub the, er, rub into the pork all over, working it into the cracks of the meat. Place the joint in the oven over the tray, cook for half an hour, then turn the heat down to 100/110&#730;C and pour about a centimetre of water into the tray.</p>\n<p>4. Leave to cook for 24 hours, checking occasionally and basting with the juice. Before eating, turn the oven up to full whack once again and cook the meat for another 30 minutes or so to get super-crispy crackling and a good colour on the outside.</p>\n<p>5. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 30 minutes; then you chould be able to simply fork the meat off the bone.</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-06-08T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-tjoyce","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9146634","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-01-08T10:04:49.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-25T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/healthy-recipes/cook-1-for-5-pork","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"29","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"promo, player, html, homepage, ghk","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"RBK Promo Player HTML Homepage June 8","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-06-06T05:37:45.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/kids-family/homepage-1-10-12","link_text":"RBK - Homepage 1-10-12"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/homepage-071607","link_text":"Home Page 071607"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/beauty-fashion/tips-advice/fashion/spring-fashion-2012","link_text":"30 Days of New Spring Outfits, Plus 20 Extras"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/beauty-fashion/tips-advice/fashion/michelle-williams-style","link_text":"Steal Michelle Williams' Classic Style"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/beauty-fashion/tips-advice/january-2013-new-fashion-and-accessories-under-50","link_text":"50 Fun Finds Under $50"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/beauty-fashion/tips-advice/fashion/print-trends-for-spring","link_text":"Print It!

Get him going on summertime entertaining &#151; one of his favorite pursuits &#151; and let's hope you don't have an empty stomach. Even common corn becomes absolutely mouthwatering when he describes how he prepares it: \"I precook the corn in water and milk, baste it with flavored vinaigrette or butter, and grill it to get that terrific smoky flavor. Then you can make it Cuban-style with mayonnaise, garlic, Cotija cheese, and some lime. That's just awesome!\"</p><p>Flay's love of food comes through when he's talking about it or eating it, and most especially when he's cooking it &#151; that's what has made the 47-year-old New Yorker one of the best-known and best-loved chefs on TV. Since four of his 11 top-selling cookbooks are dedicated to the thrill of the grill, it's easy to guess this season is prime time for prepping simple yet absolutely spectacular meals for friends and family. And, good guy that he is, he's eager to share his best tips for summer entertaining with <i>Good Housekeeping</i> readers. </p><p>Each summer weekend, Flay leaves his bustling food empire in Manhattan behind and heads to the Hamptons, where he and his wife, actress Stephanie March (best known for her role on <i>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</i> as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot), have built an environmentally friendly cedar-shingled retreat. An imposing mansion was never in their plans; instead, it's a place where the living is easy. \"Everyone who visits says, 'Wow, this is the most comfortable house I've ever been in,' \" he reports with pride. </p><p>On these relaxed weekends, the celebrity chef becomes a typical husband and father. OK, maybe with one exception &#151; while most people would prefer not to work on their days off, Flay just can't stay out of the kitchen. \"I know it's very unusual for someone to say that what he does for a profession is also what he does to relax,\" says Flay, \"but I absolutely love<i> </i>cooking.\" </p><p>So, after a morning workout to clear his head and stay fit (he has run three New York City marathons and is training for a triathlon with <i>Today </i>show anchor Natalie Morales), Flay heads straight for the kitchen. \"My whole day is glued together by food,\" he says. If Texan-born March wakes up craving her favorite Southern breakfast, Flay gets to work making biscuits, gravy, and sausage. If Sophie, his 16-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, has a slumber party, he whips up a brunch buffet (pancakes, eggs and bacon &#151; the works) the next morning for the kids. All the while, he's thinking about soaking wood chips, firing up the grill, and deciding what's for lunch: grilled pizza, or maybe fish tacos? </p><p>But the action really starts when Flay makes plans for dinner. The Hamptons may be famous for glitzy celebrity parties, but Flay is happiest when the festivities are at his house and the dress code is swimsuits and sunblock, with him manning the grill. </p>\n<br

only problem with putting a good burger on your restaurant's menu is that you suddenly become a burger joint, and if you have any inflated ideas of yourself as a chef, this can mess with them. As you hunch over the counter in your chef's whites &#151; with your apron neatly tied, your side towel folded just so, your tasting spoons glinting in front of you &#151; and you fill your 30th ramekin of ketchup, you think, \"<i>Hmm.</i> This is not exactly what I had pictured for myself.\" But the home cook will not suffer this existential setback for the few occasions in a year when you make yourself a burger, and this one is a genuine knockout. The addition of lamb to the not-too-lean chuck gives the burger a discernible gamey richness and helps deepen the flavor of ground beef, which on its own can be slightly tinny and mineral-tasting from the iron &#151; especially true of grass-fed beef. The parsley-shallot butter takes the \"joint\" right out of this burger and puts it in the restaurant league.</p>\n\n<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>\n<p><b>Serves 4</b></p><p> 2 cloves garlic</p><p> &#190; cups peeled and roughly chopped shallots</p><p> 2 cups picked, clean parsley leaves</p><p> 3&#189; teaspoons coarse kosher salt (do not use fine iodized salt)</p><p> 1 pound unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, at room temperature</p><p> 1 pound excellent-quality ground chuck</p><p> &#189; pound excellent-quality ground lamb</p><p> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</p><p> 1 tablespoon olive oil</p><p> 4 ounces sharp white cheddar (sliced into 4 slices)</p><p>Thomas' Original sandwich-size English muffins</p>\n\n<p><h2>Directions</h2></p>\n<p>In a food processor, chop the garlic and shallots finely. Add parsley leaves and 1&#189; teaspoons salt, and also process to fine. Add butter and process to smooth and emerald-green.</p><p>Run your hands under very cold water for a minute &#151; this will keep the meat from getting gummy &#151; then gently combine the two meats. Divide the meat into four equal portions (six ounces each), then gently form into patties that are 1&#188; inches thick and three inches in diameter. Season each patty all over &#151; top, bottom, and the circumference &#151; with &#189; teaspoon salt and &#189; teaspoon black pepper. Touch the patties as tenderly and as little as possible &#151; the more you manhandle and compact the meat, the tougher it becomes. </p><p>Heat a cast-iron skillet on low heat for two minutes, then increase the heat to medium-high, add 1 tablespoon oil, and place patties in pan. Cover with a splatter screen, if you own one, to minimize the mess on your stove top. Cook for seven minutes on one side, flip, and cook for five more minutes. Do not turn, touch, press down on, or otherwise molest the burgers while they are cooking. Place cheese on top and either place in a hot oven or under the broiler until the cheese is just melted but not liquefied.</p><p>Split four of the English muffins by deeply pricking them along the horizontal seam with the tines of a dinner fork. Toast well and generously smear both the tops and the bottoms with the room-temperature parsley-shallot butter, \"wall to wall\" as we say at Prune, so that every bite will be seasoned and not just the center ones. (The remaining butter can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to six weeks &#151; it is delicious on everything from toast to steak.) Place the burgers on the bottoms and close with the buttered English muffin lids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of salt needed in the recipe; we regret the error.</p>","article_links":[{"video_link":"","__total_count__":1,"slideshow_link":""}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite - Article 2.0 (Video

Try these tips to ease your over-anxiety:</p>\n<p>Schedule a daily worry space to allow yourself to think about what&#146;s bothering you. If you feel anxious at other times of the day, tell yourself to put it on hold for later and use distraction &#150; crosswords, Sudoku, backwards counting &#150; it&#146;s harder to worry if your brain is busy.</p>\n<p>Challenge your thinking. Write things down &#150; seeing it in black and white can put things into perspective. Notice negative language (can&#146;t, won&#146;t, shouldn&#146;t) that fuels the downward spiral, and make a conscious effort to use more positive words.</p>\n<p>Address physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, fast breathing and tense muscles by taking five minutes out to focus on slow, calm breathing</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-stress-management-help-with-stress/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lower your stress levels</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Body clock</h3>\n<p>Did you know that you&#146;re more creative at the time of day when you actually feel groggiest? While morning people will intuitively schedule demanding tasks for early in the day and night owls save them for later, researchers at Albion College in the US found that when it comes to thinking outside the box, you perform better when you&#146;re outside your time comfort zone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/get-the-timing-right-36796\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get the timing right: the best time of day to do everything</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Core stability</h3>\n<p>Your core muscles are important for every movement you make &#150; they&#146;re the deep muscles within your spine and pelvis that stabilise and strengthen your body. And if your core is strong you&#146;ll look longer and leaner as well! To help strengthen your core, lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat, spine in neutral and your legs hip distance apart. Pull in your lower abdomen as far as you can, as if you&#146;re zipping up a tight pair of jeans. Hold for a count of 10 if you can, breathe normally and repeat 10 times. Do this simple exercise every day.</p>\n<h3>Detox</h3>\n<p>New research is emerging that suggests that occasional fasting &#150; cutting calories down to a minimal 500-800 a day &#150; could have positive health benefits. Professor Mark Mattson of the US National Institute on Aging has studied the impact of calorie restriction. He suggests that intermittent fasting can lead to a drop in blood sugar levels, a fall in the hormones linked with cancer and diabetes, lower levels of harmful blood fats and less inflammation. It may also trigger protective processes in the brain, potentially guarding against Alzheimer&#146;s and Parkinson&#146;s disease. However, doctors don&#146;t recommend cutting down calories in such an extreme way on a regular basis. If you have any long-term health problems, don&#146;t detox without asking your doctor &#150; and don&#146;t see it as an alternative to healthy eating for the majority of the time.</p>\n<p><strong>How to detox: <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/diet/detoxing-detox-diets-how-to-detox\" target=\"_self\">products to buy and plans to try</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Energy</h3>\n<p>If your get-up-and-go has vanished, try these simple steps to help you recharge:</p>\n<p>Identify the energy vampires &#150; the tasks, or the people, who suck the life out of you, and try to cut out the least essential and rewarding.</p>\n<p>Resolve that every time someone tries to rope you in you&#146;ll take five minutes before responding. If there&#146;s a &#145;should&#146; or &#145;ought to&#146; attached to it, say no. The first time you refuse is always the hardest.</p>\n<p>Know your limits &#150; you can always cram a few more things into your day, but how will it leave you feeling? Remember that energy is your most precious resource, so make sure you use it wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Discover how to <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/get-more-energy-in-5-minutes-flat-32655\" target=\"_self\">get more energy in 5 minutes flat</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Friendship</h3>\n<p>Make time for friends and you are investing in your own wellbeing. Good friendships don&#146;t only make us happy &#150; research shows that they also help us to de-stress, feel good about ourselves, provide vital support when the going gets tough, help us live longer and keep our brains healthy as we get older, too.</p>\n<h3>Good bugs</h3>\n<p>Is it worth taking probiotic yogurts and supplements for a healthier gut? If you have an infectious tummy bug, suffer from IBS or inflammatory bowel disease, the answer may be yes, says Professor Roger Jones of the charity Core, which fights gut and liver disease. You can also help feed your body&#146;s supply of good bugs by eating more lentils, oats, bananas, asparagus and leeks &#150; they&#146;re all rich in prebiotics that stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial probiotic gut bacteria. Take probiotics for at least four weeks to see an effect, but remember they are all different and the effects are strain specific, so if one type doesn&#146;t work, try another. For more information, see the British Nutrition Foundation&#146;s probiotics guide at <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">www.nutrition.org.uk</a>.</p>\n<h3>Hair</h3>\n<p>&#145;When it comes to your general health, hair is an incredibly sensitive barometer. It&#146;s also one of the fastest cell reproducers in your body &#150; second only to bone marrow,&#146; says leading trichologist Philip Kingsley. &#145;The hair&#146;s reaction to illness is an invaluable diagnostic tool and sudden hair loss or hair thinning can indicate an underlying problem like anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, hormonal disturbances or nutritional inadequacies.&#146; For healthy hair, he recommends including iron-rich meat, fruit, salad and plenty of water in your diet.</p>\n<h3>IBS</h3>\n<p>If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and struggle to find anything to calm troublesome symptoms, it could be time to try hypnosis. Recent research carried out by Gloucestershire Royal Hospital revealed that some 90% of IBS patients treated with hypnotherapy experienced a significant improvement in symptoms, and 40% found that their condition cleared up completely. Hypnosis works by inducing a state of altered consciousness that appears to relieve symptoms and help people feel more in control.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/prima/is-it-irritable-bowel-syndrome-24771\" target=\"_self\">How to check if your symptoms might mean IBS</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Joint health</h3>\n<p>The latest research suggests that fish oils may go beyond relieving joint pain and could actually slow down the progress of osteoarthritis. Bristol University researchers who gave omega 3 fatty acids to guinea pigs (an animal that naturally develops the disease) found that those treated with fish oil had a 50% reduction in disease. &#145;This research brings us closer to understanding how omega 3 might fundamentally interfere with the osteoarthritis process and that it could potentially be taken as a treatment,&#146; says Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/issues/look-after-your-joints-56588\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Look after your joints</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Knitting</h3>\n<p>Believe it or not, clicking away can induce relaxation, improve mood and even relieve pain. Betsan Corkhill, a former physiotherapist who runs a knitting group in the pain clinic at Bath&#146;s Royal United Hospital, says: &#145;It&#146;s the bilateral, repetitive, rhythmic movements of knitting that make it so helpful, and the research shows it can bring on a meditative-like state, which helps relieve stress and pain, and promotes general wellbeing.&#146; The effect is so powerful that Betsan&#146;s group <a href=\"http://www.stitchlinks.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.stitchlinks.com</a> is now launching a network of therapeutic knitting groups around the country.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/knitting/10-reasons-to-love-knitting-fb2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>10 reasons to love knitting</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Laughter</h3>\n<p>There&#146;s no better guarantee to lighten your load, melt away stress and give you a health boost all at the same time than having a good laugh.

What prompted the move?</strong><br />I'd been at Chiat\\Day for 20 years, climbing up the ladder, nose to the grindstone. I had tons of clients, amazing teams, and lots of friends. Then I had a great meeting with Kevin Roberts, Saatchi's worldwide CEO. I hadn't had a new mentor in a long time, and I needed a life change. It was very painful to leave, but when someone says, \"You have more to learn. Take my hand, we're going to create new brands, we are going to create new experiences,\" you say, \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p><strong>How has the transition been?</strong><br />During my first few months, I was at a very important internal meeting and had to leave for my 8-year-old daughter's dance performance. Things had started to get heated in the room, when I saw Kurt Ritter, CEO of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi LA, look at the clock. He said, \"I'm sorry, I have to escort Margaret to her car because she has to be somewhere.\" To have my new boss do that for me was overwhelming. He has a sign above his office door that says, \"Everyone matters.\" That's why I'm here.</p>\n<p><strong>Who gets ahead in advertising &#8212; the most creative person in the room or the hardest-working?</strong><br />If you don't have the talent, at some point you're going to hit a ceiling. But so much is about the late nights. If you have the perseverance to get to a hundredth idea and the talent to make sure it's as fresh as your first, you are going to make it. I probably wasn't the most clever or the best designer, but man, if you gave me a shot, I would be here day and night trying to make the best of the talent I had.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you carve out time for a personal life? </strong><br />It wasn't always a priority for me. I've spent plenty of nights working late and have had plenty of friends I didn't see. It's never a typical 9-to-5 workday, especially if we've got multiple shoots and I have to fly somewhere. But either I spend 20 minutes on Facebook or 20 minutes with both my kids finishing homework. It's important to note that I have an amazing husband &#8212; he's an entertainment lawyer &#8212; who's really my biggest fan and has supported me in every way. Whenever there's a conflict, like if one of us has to go out of town for business, we work it out. That kind of support system is crucial. He really believes in me &#8212; he is my greatest cheerleader.</p>\n<p><strong>You share your title with your longtime creative partner, Chris Adams, who made the leap to Saatchi with you. Is he your office spouse? </strong><br />Chris and I have more of a brother-sister thing going on. We have a lot in common: Both of us are only children. Our moms worked with people with special needs, and our dads are professors. Last Christmas we vacationed together with our families. Not all creative partnerships work as well. Some people are put together but aren't compatible emotionally. But Chris and I draft off each other, and boy, we can create some mad ideas together.</p>\n<p><strong>Who comes up with the concepts? </strong><br />We have teams that come up with ideas, and Chris and I put the cherry on top. Last year, for the Super Bowl, we let all the creatives in the agency pitch ideas, from the kids all the way up. When Chris and I were young, we always wanted to work on everything. So we make sure everybody gets a shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Which of your ad campaigns are you most proud of?</strong><br />I was privileged to work on Apple's \"Think Different\" campaign when I was just 27. One of my greatest triumphs was the Pedigree adoption drive that Chris and I created, which raised millions for dog adoption. But the same rules apply that you see in <em>Mad Men</em> &#8212; it has to be engaging and it has to be great.</p>\n<p><strong>How has the industry changed from the <em>Mad Men</em> era?</strong><br />I've got to come clean. Someone who was pitching me some Procter &amp; Gamble work said, \"I want you to work on it is because you're a frat guy in a woman's body.\" There's some truth to that: I'm not a girly-girl. I've always gotten along well with men, and that helps me a lot. Recently I hired a bunch of women, which is a priority of mine, but I'm not going to hire someone just because they wear a bra. They have to have a great sense of humor and be highly collaborative. They have to have skills.</p>\n<p><strong>How close is your experience to the show?</strong><br />Nothing has changed and everything has changed. I think all the ad girls out there can relate to Peggy's ability to talk to the guys and her need to create her own persona among them. The parallels are ever-present: You can't become so masculine that you're not yourself, but you also can't act so feminine that you're not taken seriously. We have very smart clients, but at the end of the day, many were in fraternities or played football, and if you didn't participate in that, it can be difficult to hang with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Are more women applying for jobs than, say, when you first started? </strong><br />I have to spend more effort finding them. I think that's because you're working 24/7 for the first 10 years. Then it starts to get really competitive right around the time you want to get married and have kids. So it's quite a compromise to figure out the lifestyle. The good news is that it really does seem to be changing. Also, for decades, men have been writing about women from the male perspective, and there's a whole generation of women calling bullshit on that.</p>\n<p><strong>Seems pretty casual around here. Can you wear whatever you want?</strong><br />I tend to wear a lot of black. I've been trying to work on my color because I'm supposed to be a creative person. Our office is right next door to Target.

Solution: stitch the pintucks before cutting out the front. This lined silk camisole is bias-cut to flow flatteringly over the contours. Depending on the fabric you choose, the camisole doesn&#146;t have to be lined.</p>\n<p><strong>Fit</strong></p>\n<p>To fit size small, bust 86cm (34in). For other sizes, adjust the pattern by enlarging or taking in down the centre front and centre back. To do this, divide the difference between 86cm (34in) and your bust measurement by four. Fold the pattern pieces in half lengthways and increase or decrease the pattern at both the centre front and the centre back fold by this amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>\n<p>&#149; 2m (21&#8260;4yd) fine silk</p>\n<p>&#149; 115cm (45in) wide</p>\n<p>&#149; Thread</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting out</strong></p>\n<p>&#149; Make up the <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-women/free-sewing-pattern-sew-pintucked-camisole-templates\" target=\"_blank\">pattern pieces on page 2&#160;</a>according to the instructions.</p>\n<p>&#149; Cut one main back piece and one each of the front and back lining pieces (which are slightly shorter)</p>\n<p>&#149; Cut two shoulder straps, 43 x 4cm (17 x 11&#8260;2in)</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The pintucks need to be worked before you cut out the top-layer front piece. So pin the pattern piece on the bias on the remaining fabric and cut a generous square around it, ensuring that there is a minimum of 10cm (4in) of fabric on either side of the pattern piece</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Fold and press the fabric in half lengthways. Using tailor&#146;s chalk and a ruler, draw a line 37cm (141&#8260;2in) down this fold. This is the position of the central pin tuck. Draw the rest of the pintucks in decreasing lengths of 35cm (133&#8260;4in), 27cm (103&#8260;4in), 22cm (83&#8260;4in), 18cm (7in) and 15cm (6in) on either side, spacing them 12mm (1&#8260;2in) apart.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Starting with the central pintuck, fold the fabric along the marked line and place a pin at the end position of the pintuck. Stitch as close as you can to the fold and leave long threads at the end. Refold the fabric at the position of the second pintuck and repeat the process. Stitch all the pintucks in the same way. Thread each of the threads at the bottom of the pintucks onto a needle and pass them through to the back of the fabric. Tie each pair of threads together securely and then trim the ends.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"/cm/allaboutyou/images/bg/PR-Sewing-Made-Simple-book-150x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"10\" />This pattern is taken from 'Sewing Made Simple' by Tessa Evelegh (Jacqui Small, &#163;25). <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781906417659\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to buy it for &#163;18.99 from Allaboutyou's online bookshop</a><br /></strong></p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/make-clothes/free-sewing-pattern-sew-a-skirt\" target=\"_blank\">Sew the simplest-ever skirt - from the same book</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/make-clothes/make-a-beaded-camisole-51677\" target=\"_blank\">Trim a camisole with lace</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/make-clothes/sew-a-fabric-watch-strap-56579\" target=\"_blank\">Sew a fabric watch strap</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-06-05T14:24:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"6","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"30.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9229196","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2011-11-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-12-08T07:41:03.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-women/free-sewing-pattern-sew-pintucked-camisole","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Prepare to be blown away!

She&#8217;d heard a rumor that a naked picture of Liz and me was going around! I felt my face get hot; suddenly I was convinced everyone was staring through my clothes, picturing me naked. I started racking my brain, trying to piece together what happened.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>GIRLS&#8217; NIGHT IN</strong></p>\n<p>A few days earlier, Liz had come to my house after gymnastics practice. Since school was almost over, our parents said she could sleep over. Just after midnight, we decided to get ready for bed and hop in the shower together. (We were used to showering with each other because of cheerleading and gymnastics.) We were in a hyper mood, cracking each other up and being the type of deliriously silly you can be only with your best friend. And just before we jumped in the shower, we took a pic on our phones: It was of the reflection of us in the mirror, standing naked and smiling. I took mine in sepia, Liz took hers in black-and- white. It was one of those silly pictures you take at sleepovers or camp that you don&#8217;t think about. But just then, as I was standing in the hall freaking out, it was the only thing I could think about.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>STOLEN SECRETS</strong></p>\n<p>Turns out, the picture everyone had was black-and-white&#8212;which meant it had come from Liz&#8217;s phone. Liz was stunned; she never sent it to anyone! We hadn&#8217;t even told anyone about it. The only thing we could think was that someone must have flipped through Liz&#8217;s photos over the weekend and sent it around. You would think if you had a picture you were worried about, you&#8217;d be careful; but neither of us thought much about it when we took it, or afterward. That day, I really wasn&#8217;t focused on who stole the pic, though; I was just trying to attract as little attention as possible. I hated walking around not knowing who&#8217;d seen it; I felt like I couldn&#8217;t make eye contact with anyone. And my boyfriend, nick, was so angry; not at me, but that everyone knew what his girlfriend looked like naked. The only good thing was that school was ending, and summer would put this behind us.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RUDE AWAKENING</strong></p>\n<p>But in august, Liz&#8217;s mom and my parents got a call: one of our principals had received an unmarked envelope with a printout of the picture in it! &#8220;Why would you do something like that, Brooke?&#8221; my mom asked. I felt so guilty that I&#8217;d let my parents down. That&#8217;s when I told them the whole story. Then we went to see the principals, who said they had to take disciplinary action: I got kicked off cheer because I was &#8220;a bad representative of the school and squad.&#8221; I burst into tears; I couldn&#8217;t believe I was being punished so majorly for something that had been stolen from Liz and that had embarrassed me enough. To make things worse, the principals couldn&#8217;t believe we took the picture randomly, with no intention of showing our boyfriends or other people to get attention. They didn&#8217;t get that so many normal girls do stuff like this all the time; it felt like they thought we were dirty or bad or lying to them.</p>\n<p>Once my parents were involved, they reported everything to the police. They wanted to figure out who stole the picture; they thought it was unfair that the person who stole or sent the picture wasn&#8217;t being punished. One guy even posted on a blog that he had the photo, if anyone wanted it&#8212;and all he got was a warning.</p>\n<p>The police questioned Liz and me and interviewed suspects. But they never proved who did it. I wish I could go back in time and not take the picture. There was nothing to gain by doing it&#8212;and I&#8217;ll never do anything like that again.</p>\n<p>*Name has been changed.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/sweepstakes/23928\">here</a> to WIN a copy of the ebook AND a Kindle from Amazon!</p>\n<p>Start reading in seconds on your reader, tablet, smart phone or personal computer!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Buy the ebook:<br /></span></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Shocking-True-Teen-Stories-ebook/dp/B007ZHZZLA\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a><br /><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/shocking-true-teen-stories/id520573907\" target=\"_blank\">Apple iBookstore</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/shocking-true-teen-stories-seventeen/1110609370?ean=9781453259023\" target=\"_blank\">Barnes &amp;

I know I can earn a bit more interest with an online bank, but I'm worried about security. What do you think?</b></p><p><b>A.</b> I've read the same scary hacking news stories you have. But think of it this way: The biggest business threat to any online bank is losing the security of your information and holdings, so protecting that is its number one job. \"Banks offer software that can prevent malware from infecting end users' machines in the first place and from stealing their information when they bank online and use other websites,\" says Yishay Yovel, VP of marketing for Trusteer, a security firm that works with more than 200 banks and credit unions. </p><p>Also know that banks confirm your identity with a username/password system and may ask security questions if they don't recognize your device's unique IP address. Tip: As I've been telling folks for years, the best way to protect yourself is never to respond to an unsolicited request from a source that looks like your bank but asks you to send back personal information. </p><p>Last, let me mention that online banks don't have to pay salaries for tellers or rent for branches, so they offer higher interest rates and fewer fees. Do, however, make sure the bank you choose is FDIC-insured and has good ratings for customer service. A quick, free search on <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bankrate.com</a> shows that ING Direct offers 0.8% interest on savings accounts with no minimum balance or fees. For checking accounts, Ally Bank is offering 0.4% with no minimum balance or fees. In terms of brick-and-mortar businesses, only credit unions can come close to offering that kind of deal. </p><p><b>Q: The headlines have me scared of the stock market, but the returns on other retirement investments are so low. Should I be in the market?</b></p><p><b>A.</b> I'll assume your permanent date with a beach chair is 10 to 20-plus years away. You have a long-term goal of retirement as far as this money goes, but you're looking at short-term numbers &#151; that darned 2% to 4%. To earn more, you must expose yourself to risk. It's the trade-off, as it is in life. </p><p>First, make your stomach less queasy by educating yourself about where your money is and what your options are. You definitely should not have all your money in the stock market at one time (even if you have decades until retirement), and steer clear of holding individual stocks &#151; too risky. You need a mix of assets, but most of all, you need a strategy. When was the last time you sat with your 401(k) administrator or adviser? Through recent regulations by the Department of Labor, 401(k) providers are required to provide plan participants not only with information about a plan's administrative and investment fees, but also with investment information in a way that allows the participants to \"meaningfully compare the investment options.\" In addition, your employer may offer you the services of an adviser. If it doesn't, or if you don't feel comfortable with the individual, find a qualified financial planner at <a href=\"http://www.fpanet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">fpanet.org</a>. Then ask for info on different funds' performance over time and at various risk levels. And be clear regarding your concerns: \"I'm nervous; what can I do to reach my long-term goals but also protect what I have from market swings?\" </p><p>As you take in the advice, use this cheat sheet: Most retirement plans have categories you can choose to invest in, which tend to use certain words, such as \"value,\" to describe stock funds that may hold undervalued (or, as I like to say, \"really well priced!\") companies. These often pay a dividend, or returns on each share. The \"growth\" option may be more risky &#151; these are invested in, say, growing tech firms &#151; but for someone with 20-plus years until retirement, this is worth a slice of your investing pie so you can capture some profit. \"Money market\" or stable funds are considered the most conservative investments, but they won't turbo-charge your profits. \"Small-cap\" refers to smaller, riskier companies and \"large-cap\" to larger, often safer ones. You want a mix of risk levels and returns that fits your situation. Above all, keep a long-term view. Schedule specific times to look at your investments &#151; say, once per quarter. As for daily headlines? They can be an expensive distraction that keeps you from where you should be looking &#151; toward the end of the long work road. </p><p><b>Q: I'm overwhelmed with bills. We haven't earned enough this year to stay on time with everything. Whom should I pay first every month?</b></p><p><b>A.</b> You're in a tough situation, but I've got a system called PCF (Pay, Cut, Find) to help you stay on top of your bills. First, find out exactly whom you owe, what you owe, and how much it's costing you (interest and fees). Set up a simple list or spreadsheet pulling together all the bills for the month (feel free to arrange for a \"reward\" while doing this &#151; a brownie or a glass of wine). Note interest rates, totals owed, minimum payments, fees, and due dates. </p><p>Now you need to \"Pay,\" and the priority is the roof over your head. Always pay your mortgage (or rent), homeowners' insurance, and property taxes first. Then move on to \"C,\" for \"cutting other costs.\" Set a date on your calendar this week to shop around for lower-cost utilities; try <a href=\"http://www.lowermybills.com/\" target=\"_blank\">lowermybills.com</a>. If you're well behind with these bills, call your service provider and ask for a payment plan that can help you catch up. You probably need to drive to work, but can you carpool or ask your boss if you can work from home one day a week, thereby reducing your commuting costs? </p><p>Also note that you can often cut down those debt payments by calling your lender to negotiate lower rates or even a settlement. If you're skittish about making these calls, see a local nonprofit credit counselor (<a href=\"http://www.nfcc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">nfcc.org</a>) for a low-cost assessment of your debt and tips on how to pay less. </p><p>Now, \"F,\" for \"find more money\": Are you open to doing household tasks such as pet care, laundry, or running errands for pay? Or maybe you have other skills that you have time to share? <a href=\"http://www.taskrabbit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Taskrabbit.com</a> lets you offer yourself up locally for various tasks for a fee. Do you have a recent-model car that you can rent out? <a href=\"http://www.getaround.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Getaround.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.relayrides.com/\" target=\"_blank\">relayrides.com</a> let you rent your car out by the hour, day, or week. And if you have an extra bedroom, offer it up for a bed-and-breakfast &#151; type rental at <a href=\"http://www.airbnb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">airbnb.com</a>. There are also sites that let you rent out equipment you own, such as lawn-care items. </p><p>Following PCF will set you up not only to get on track with your bills this month, but to stay that way years from now. Thank goodness for that! </p>\n<br />\n<h3>HAVE A QUESTION?</h3><p>Send it to Carmen at <a href=\"mailto:carmen@goodhousekeeping.com?subject=Question%20for%20Carmen%20Wong%20Ulrich\">carmen@goodhousekeeping.com</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-05T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1037619","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/s7/0712-house-model-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Wong Ulrich","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":"about-carmen-wong-ulrich","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8964514","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/money-questions-answered\">The 10 Money Questions I'm Always Asked</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-diet\">The Money Diet: How to Achieve Financial Fitness This Year</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-questions-financial-planning-advice\">Carmen Answers Your Money Questions </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/common-money-mistakes\">5 Most Common Money Mistakes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/marriage-sex/sex-tips-for-women\">8 of Your Most Common Questions About Sex &mdash; Answered</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/how-to-save-money-in-summer\">10 Ways to Save Money This Summer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-resolutions\">A Year's Worth of Money Resolutions</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/125-tips-to-save-money\">125 Ways to Manage Your Money </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/pet-adoption\">10 Questions to Ask Before Adopting a Pet</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/managing-parents-money\">Protect Your Parents' Money </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-07-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:41:50.000Z","author_id":"11564","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/budget/money-questions-financial-planning-advice","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"How to shoo away life's little annoyances","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"common obstacles, annoying things, dealing with annoyances, overcoming obstacles, obstacles life, obstacles in life, challenges in life, life challenges","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Sunny Side Up","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-07-02T15:41:23.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/makeup/best-bargain-beauty-products","link_text":"The Best New Makeup Finds  Under $20!"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/most-popular-hairstyles","link_text":"Most Popular Celebrity Hairstyles of All Time"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/best-haircuts","link_text":"5 Best Haircuts of All Time"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/marriage-sex/spice-up-your-marriage","link_text":"10 Fun Ways to Spice Up Your Marriage"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/keys-to-happiness","link_text":"3 Keys to Lasting Happiness"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/womens-health/11-worst-foods","link_text":"11 Worst Foods for Your Health"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health/how-to-overcome-obstacles","link_text":"Overcoming Life's Obstacles"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/celebrity-interviews/michael-j-fox-interview","link_text":"Interview with Michael J.

We're all under the influence of the \"negativity bias,\" a well-recognized psychological phenomenon which means, in sum, that bad has a stronger pull than good. We remember bad news better than good news. When our thoughts are wandering, unoccupied, we tend to begin to brood, because anxious or angry thoughts capture our attention more effectively than happier thoughts do. And what sticks in your memory better: that compliment someone gave you &#151; or the criticism?</p><p>So, while I search for the \"bluebird of happiness,\" I'm also on the lookout for the \"pigeon of discontent.\" </p><p>A pigeon of discontent isn't a major happiness challenge, but rather an ordinary problem that has settled in to roost. For example: <i>I haven't been going to the gym regularly; I bicker with my kids each morning; my closet is a mess; I haven't read a book for fun in months. </i></p><p>To live a happier life, it's very helpful to try to identify these pigeons and find ways to shoo them away.</p><p>When I asked my blog readers about what pigeons of discontent plagued them, I got a flurry of responses. We all have these! Here are six of the most common ones:</p><p><b>1. Why can't I convince myself to get to bed on time every night?</b> This question is critically important. For most of us, that extra hour or two of sleep is elusive, so we're constantly cranky and tired. So many adults are chronically sleep-deprived, and although they fool themselves into believing they've adjusted to a lack of sleep, research shows they're quite impaired. Ring a bell? Try this: Give yourself a specific bedtime. Kids have a definite bedtime, and adults need one, too. Most of us need at least seven hours of sleep each night; do the math to figure out at what time you need to turn out the lights. I have a friend who gets up at 6:30 A.M. to get her children off to school, but she regularly goes to bed at about 1:00 A.M.! \"I feel so overwhelmed and drained all the time,\" she told me. \"What's wrong with me?\" It had never occurred to her that she'd feel a lot better if she gave herself a bedtime of 10:30 P.M.     </p><p><b>2. How do I avoid beingdragged down by difficult family members? </b>This problem is so pressing and pervasive that maybe it should be called an \"elephant of discontent\" rather than just a pigeon. One strategy that helps me is to allow these folks to see the world in their own way. It's tempting to try to cheer them up or to convince them that the glass is half-full rather than half-empty, but such debates just exhaust me and annoy them. I remind myself that I'm better off acknowledging another person's feelings and point of view. To a surprising degree, once you make it clear that you understand what someone else is feeling and thinking, the situation becomes calmer and less depleting. For example, \"Wow, Mom, that exchange with the cable guy must have been so infuriating.\"</p><p><b>3. I feel discouraged by my messy house.</b> For most people, outer order contributes to inner calm &#151; more than it should. Something like a crowded coat closet or an overflowing inbox is a trivial matter in the context of a happy life, but these little things weigh us down. To keep the scum of clutter from accumulating, I follow the \"one-minute rule.\" If I can do a task in less than one minute, I do it without delay. I rip open a letter, skim it, and toss it. I hang up my coat. I put the lid on the peanut butter jar, put the jar in the cabinet, and close the cabinet door. I also make sure to make my bed every morning! It's such a small thing, but it's a real happiness booster.</p><p><b>4. Why am I always late, even when I give myself extra time? </b>It's important to figure out why you're late. Are you late because you oversleep? Try going to sleep earlier (see pigeon number one). Do you underestimate your commute time? Actually time yourself for a week. People tend to be optimistic, rather than realistic, about how long a commute takes. You can't find your keys/wallet/phone/sunglasses? Train yourself to put vital items in exactly the same place every time you walk into the house. You try to get one last thing done? This is one of the most common, and overlooked, causes of tardiness. If you always try to answer one more e-mail or put away one more load of laundry before you leave, here's a way to outwit yourself: Take along a task to do when you reach your destination. Tell yourself that you need an extra 10 minutes on the other end to read those brochures or fill out that form.</p><p><b>5. I feel great after exercising, but can't seem to make it a part of my daily routine. </b>Surely one of the most common pigeons of discontent. My idea of fun has always been to lie in bed reading, preferably while also eating a snack &#151; but I've managed to keep myself exercising over the years by using several tricks: Always exercise on Monday &#151; that sets the pattern for the week. If possible, exercise first thing in the morning, before excuses or distractions start popping up. Give yourself credit for the smallest effort; if you've got your walking shoes on and the front door closes behind you, that counts. Look for affordable ways to make exercise more pleasant: Pay more for a gym that's close to work; buy a pedometer; check out some audiobooks from the library to make running more interesting; get a sitter so you can go to your favorite class on Saturday mornings. Exercise is a high life priority, so this is a worthwhile place to spend some money if that helps and you actually do it.</p><p><b>6. I'm overwhelmed by all the big projects around the house. </b>We often overestimate what we can do in the short term and underestimate what we can do in the long term, if we do a little bit each day. When I have a big task, I commit to working on it each day. Counterintuitively, it's often easier to do something every day rather than some days or most days. I was so behind with my own photo albums, and so overwhelmed by the massive chore of getting them up to date, that I vowed that I would \"suffer for 15 minutes\" each day. Day after day, in 15-minute bits, I worked on those albums &#151; until I finished them. Because I knew I only had to do it for 15 minutes each time, I was able to keep at it. </p><p>As I've tried other little steps to rid our home of the pigeons of discontent, my favorite strategy has turned out to be something, quick, easy, and delightful. I go out of my way to kiss and hug every member of my family every day. Truthfully, hugging and kissing doesn't get rid of all the pigeons &#151; but it makes those pigeons irk me much less.</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>E-mail Gretchen at <a href=\"mailto:gretchen@goodhousekeeping.com?subject=Question%20for%20Gretchen%20Rubin\">gretchen@goodhousekeeping.com</a>.</b> </p>\n<br />\n<h3>Happiness Thought for July</h3><p>We often overestimate what we can do in the short term and underestimate what we can do in the long term, if we do a little each day.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-05T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1037637","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/vJ/gretchen-rubin-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Rubin","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jgordon","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-gretchen-rubin","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8964513","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/how-to-overcome-obstacles\">Overcoming Life's Obstacles </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/michael-j-fox-interview\">Interview with Michael J.

He was awesome. He baked homemade gluten-free cookies when it was his turn for Snack. He could kiss a boo-boo, dress his daughter <em>and</em> do her hair, commiserate over nap schedules, and analyze a fever with the best of us mommies. As for the fact that he was a man; I'm embarrassed to admit that after the first couple of weeks, during which we tried (in vain) to censor our labor-and-delivery stories and skip the breast-leakage discussions, we barely noticed he was a dude at all. He became just like one of the girls&#151;and we treated him that way. While he never complained, a few years and a few dozen interviews with other stay-at-home dads later, I now realize that SAHM does not equal SAHD. Neither one is \"better,\" and dads bring their own unique skills to the parenting equation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we are slow to act on this fact. Whether a dad stays home and does the bulk of the childcare, or he fulfills a more traditional nine-to-five role but is still an active parent, he gets no love from the Mom Media Machine, as evidenced by the hullaballoo over <em>Wired</em> magazine's June cover story, \"<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/05/ff_gd_essay\" target=\"_blank\">The Rise of the Geek Dad</a>.\" The article talks about a \"new\" breed of dads that like to do quirky science-y stuff with their kids, and I was glad to see dads getting some parenting recognition. It didn't even occur to me that some women would take offense, pointing out that moms can do geeky cool stuff with their kids too. While they make a good point about the article perpetuating old stereotypes, I didn't think it was intentionally excluding moms; no more so than how every cover story featuring a mommy cuddling her baby is trying to exclude dads.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5912958/parenting-magazines-are-only-for-one-kind-of-parent\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Adamick writes</a> of the <em>Wired </em>controversy, \"This is what dads feel like pretty much all the time, every day&#151;at least when it comes to the world of parenting media. In that world, if you don't have a vagina, you don't exist.&#160;As former Rebel Dad-turned-Forbes columnist Brian Reid&#160;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/brianreid/2012/05/23/jezebel-attacks-wired-for-dad-cover-now-if-theyd-only-go-after-parenting-rags/\">points out</a>, \"Parenting.com lists a moms section on its header, but doesn't bother with dads. <em>Parents Magazine</em> has a MomBuzz section, but no dads.\" And now I feel compelled to add that this blog is called... Mamarama. Even though we are a mom council, we love hearing from dads too!<br /><br />I'm a strong believer in the power of close female friendships, and I think it's amazing how we've created this huge community for all of us to connect. Nevertheless, I don't think that it is necessary to put men down to build women up.<br /><br />What do you think about <em>Wired's</em>&#160;cover? Should moms and dads continue to be segregated in parenting media?<br /></p>\n&#160;"}],"blog_author":"Charlotte Hilton Andersen"}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-06-04T16:36:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Hilton Andersen","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"llevine","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"Charlotte","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"9243142","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/mom/best-mom-blogs\">The Best of the Mommy Blogs </a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/parenting/stay-at-home-dad\">Happy to Be a Stay at Home Dad</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/mom/alcoholic-mom\">\"Mommy is an Alcoholic\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/parenting/working-with-spouse\">Meet America's Most Wired Family</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/celebrity-parenting-styles\">Parenting Styles of the Stars: Weird or Worth It?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/mom/stop-worrying\">Are Moms Wired to Worry?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/hs-mommy-cliques\">The Hard Stuff: \"Mommy cliques are driving me insane!\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/fathers-be-dads\">Help Fathers Be Dads </a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/mommy-memos-hl\">The Mommy Memos</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fun-contests/celebrity/hot-celebrity-dads\">25 Hot Celebrity Dads </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:25:02.000Z","author_id":"11530","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/kids-family/blogs/mom-blog/are-dads-discriminated-against","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Get ingredients and prep tips for making this month's meal accompaniments","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"easy recipes, month of menus","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"July 2012 Side Dish Recipes","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-29T20:47:34.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Woman's Day","source_id":"1","teaser":"Get ingredients and prep tips for making this month's meal accompaniments","origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":"Get ingredients and prep tips for making this month's meal accompaniments","pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"july-2012-side-dish-recipes","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-05-29T20:47:33.000Z","title":"July 2012 Side Dish Recipes","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Easy Weeknight Recipes - Quick Family Dinner Ideas","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"818","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"egillin","last_name":"Staff","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-10-19T14:33:15.000Z","id":"11829","last_updated_date":"2011-10-19T14:33:30.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Woman's Day"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<p><strong><a href=\"spaghetti-roasted-zucchini-recipe-122941\">July 3</a></strong><a name=\"1\"></a><br /> <strong>Grape Tomato Salad</strong><br /> <strong>Active Time:</strong>&#160;10 minutes<br /> <strong>Total Time:</strong>&#160;10 minutes<br /> Serves 4</p>\n<p><strong>Recipe Ingredients</strong></p>\n<p>1 pint grape tomatoes, halved<br />2 scallions, finely chopped<br />2 Tbsp olive oil<br />1 Tbsp red wine vinegar<br />Kosher salt and pepper<br />2 cups baby spinach or arugula, chopped<br />&#188;

So whoredom has paid off, royally. True, the demands of TV production keep him from boiling water, but, as George Santayana once observed, \"Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim.\"</p>\n\n<p>Evidence of a forgotten aim is patently obvious in the new, most vicious season of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> (premiering Monday night on Fox), in which the entire production is geared toward the flaying and cursing-out of the most inept bunch of allegedly professional cooks ever assembled.</p>\n\n<p><object width=\"614\" height=\"345\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ZtH8ayGUAtU?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0&showinfo=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ZtH8ayGUAtU?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0&showinfo=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"614\" height=\"345\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n\n\n<p>Despite there being nine cooks on each team (females against males), they are seemingly incapable of producing a single edible dish in under two hours. One has to wonder, where did they get these people from? Some are executive chefs at country clubs, others caterers, the rest from restaurants you've never heard of &#151; all competing to be head chef at Ramsay's new steakhouse in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n<p>The callow producers carefully chose obese cooks, tattooed cooks, bearded cooks, bald cooks, one cook who looks like Gwyneth Paltrow, each filleted by Ramsay in two- to three-second dismissals that all contain his signature \"F\"-word. At the start, they are asked to truly commit themselves to the show by shaving their heads, which turns out to be a prank.</p>\n\n<p>Then, at what seems like breakneck speed, enhanced by music that sounds cribbed from <i>Mission: Impossible</i>, each contestant cooks up a dish that is presented to Ramsay, who tastes a tiny morsel of the protein &#151; chicken, meat, fish &#151; wholly neglecting the accompaniments on the plate, pronouncing most of them \"crap\" and asking, \"Are you really a chef somewhere?\"</p>\n\n<p>Like Sacha Baron Cohen doing Borat, Bruno, and the Dictator, Ramsay never breaks character, playing the curly-blond, demonic sadist, screaming his head off with frustration, aghast at the ineptitude of those he labels imbeciles. But unlike Cohen, who is a satirist, all Ramsay has in his arsenal is foul-mouthed invective, none of it instructive, none of it in the least entertaining, unless your idea of entertainment is to watch his and the contestants' mouths bleeped every two seconds. One cook starts hyperventilating. Another, on getting a nod of approval, flutters and gasps, \"That was like the best orgasm ever.\" (One also has to wonder which director plied that line.)</p>\n\n<p>Ramsay spits the food into the garbage. \"You're crap, you're crap,\" he says, not referring to the food. \"Disgusting!\" \"Get the [bleep] outta here!\" \"Get the [bleep] upstairs!\"</p>\n\n<p>After these lashings, the teams split off to cook a meal for guests in the restaurant, yet after two hours, the women have barely gotten a scallop appetizer out, and the men can't even plate a Caesar salad. From what hospital kitchens did the producers recruit these bozos? I take that back: Hospital food always goes out on time.</p>\n\n<p>None of this nonsense would give a viewer any sense of what it's like to work in a professional kitchen, and chefs I've spoken to despise the show because it gives their profession and skills a bad name. Pro-wrestling is more believable, though not so bloody: Next week, the promos promise fights and kicks.</p>\n\n<p>If only there was a scintilla of wit, a moment of enlightenment, a sense that Ramsay can speak English without cursing twice in one sentence.
