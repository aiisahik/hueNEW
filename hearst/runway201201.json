Here, we pick the best pancake recipes around and tell you exactly how to make them. From quick, simple and easy to make crepe recipes, to fluffy American pancakes and even a healthy option for those of you who don't want to over-indulge, your Pancake Day has never been so tasty!<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE CLASSIC PANCAKE:</strong><br />If you are after the traditional crepe pancake, then this easy and quick recipe will be just perfect. <br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />110g/4oz plain flour, sifted<br />pinch of salt<br />2 eggs<br />200ml milk mixed with 75ml water<br />50g butter<br />Lemon and sugar to serve<br /><br />The method:<br /><br />Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl, making a well in the middle for the eggs. <br />Break the eggs into the well and whisk well, gradually adding adding the milk and water mixture until the batter is smooth.<br />Melt the butter in the microwave and spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk. Use the rest of the butter to grease the frying pan.<br /><br />Get the pan really hot then turn the heat down to medium before pouring in the batter mixture with a ladel.<br />Tip the pan from side to side to get it thinly and evenly coated with batter. <br />It should take around half a minute to cook (the bottom should be golden brown), then flip the pancake over with a palette knife. The other side will need a few seconds only, then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate.<br /><br />To serve, sprinkle each pancake with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a pinch of caster sugar..<br /><br />Et, voila! Your perfect crepe pancake!<br /><br />Tried and tested top tip: If you want to make this light crepe a little bit naughtier, get your favourite chocolate bar and cut it into very thin slices. When the pancake is still in the pan, spread over the top and cook until it melts. Sprinkle with chopped nutes for a little extra crunch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/midnight-in-paris_the_cosmopolitan_tour\" target=\"_blank\">COSMO'S MIDNIGHT IN PARIS TRIP - OH LA LA!</a><br /><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE FLUFFY AMERICAN PANCAKE</strong><br />If you want delicious filling pancakes that are great when loaded with toppings, then this recipe is for you.

Cut two bananas in half and fry them in the pan until golden, adding in blueberries to heat in the pan too.

Use your love muscle</h2>\n<p>Great abs may help you get lucky, but if you want to get the most from the experience you need to work on your pubococcygeal (PC) muscle. At the floor of your pelvis, it controls peeing and spasms during climax, which is why doctors and sex therapists recommend developing it to improve orgasm and reduce the chances of premature ejaculation. It's also the muscle that enables dogs to wag their tails, but that's another story entirely. Kegel exercises will develop PC power. Squeeze the muscle you use to hold back your pee. Once you've identified this muscle, tighten it, hold for two seconds, then release. Repeat 20 times, three times a day, gradually holding it tight for longer. And keep at it. \"Kegels must be done on a regular basis to have any benefit,\" says Gordon Muir, consultant urologist at King's College Hospital.</p>\n\n\n<h2>2. Take it to the edge</h2>\n<p>No technique is as successful in improving male orgasms as edging &#150; holding back at the point of no return, resting, then working up to it again. And again. And again. Practise by masturbating until you're about to come, then stop, slow your breathing and wait 30 seconds before carrying on. Or try preventing ejaculation by gently pulling down on your testicles or squeezing the tip of your penis just as you're about to orgasm. Then repeat the process. Master the art of edging and you'll achieve contractile or \"dry\" orgasms: all the fun of the Big \"O\" minus the ejaculation and subsequent loss of wood. If you practise enough you may even experience the male multiple. \"The technique can result in incredibly intense orgasms,\" says Dr Barbara Keesling, lecturer at California State University, USA.</p>\n\n\n<h2>3. Watch Saturday's big match</h2>\n<p>Or work out. Or rent <em>The Godfather Part II</em>. Or go for a run. All of these activities have been shown to raise testosterone levels. (By studies at the University of Northumbria, the College of Kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada and the University of Michingan, USA, respectively, if anyone asks.) And researchers at Athens' Military Hospital in Greece found that the more testosterone a man has in his bloodstream, the better his chances of achieving orgasm.</p>\n\n\n<h2>4. Don't play with yourself</h2>\n<p>Okay, stop \"practising\". Masturbation won't give you the kind of mind-blowing eye-roller that sex will. You know it, your partner knows it and what's more Mother Nature likes it that way. According to a study by Stuart Brody, professor of psychology at the University of Paisley in Scotland, the body releases 400% more of the hormone prolactin (which makes us feel sexually satisfied) following vaginal penetration than it does after masturbation. \"Evolutionary forces always reward behaviours associated with successful reproduction,\" says Brody. \"And penile-vaginal sex is the only sexual behaviour that passes on your genes.\"</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2013-02-06T09:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11281","promo_image_url":null,"allow_email_this":"1","total_rate":"0.00","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643910","related_links":null,"suppress_related_links":"0","editorial_notes":"dec 2006 p73","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-07T10:00:57.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"flow_id":"4","contributor_state":null,"import_type_id":null,"customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-24T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/better/how-to-improve-your-orgasm","contributor_age":null,"issue_date":"","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"These celebs love snapping the moment and posting pics to Twitter as much as we do!","site_id":"603","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"photos, prince william, arg, TOWIE, Rebel Wilson, Anne Hathaway, lady gaga, JLS, Ed Sheeran, Girls Aloud reunion, lauren conrad, Nicole Scherzinger, amber rose, saturdays, Millie Mackintosh, usher, bar refaeli, the saturdays, Michelle Mone, Jessica Alba, katy perry, poppy delevingne, Nick Grimshaw, Mark Wight, mariah carey, kelly brook, gary barlow, london olympics, victoria beckham, Khloe Kardashian, Pixie Lott, taylor kinney, melanie sykes, lingerie, the spice girls, stacy keibler, Lauren Good","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Celebs go crazy for the Super Bowl!","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-04T11:22:14.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/one-direction-zayn-malik-mum-perrie-edwards-wedding-rumour-0395","link_text":"Zayn Malik's mum: Perrie Edwards would be the 'perfect' daughter-in-law!"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/one-direction-robbie-williams-spice-girls","link_text":"Robbie WIlliams : One Direction are the new Spice Girls!"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/one-direction-zayn-malik-perrie-edwards-cheating-rumours-still-together","link_text":"Zayn Malik and Perrie Edwards \"still deeply in love\""},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/one-direction-zayn-malik-quits-twitter-due-to-internet-trolls","link_text":"1D's Zayn Malik quits Twitter"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/miley-cyrus-admits-to-stalking-one-direction-star-zayn-malik","link_text":"Watch out Zayn !

In many climates, it's an easy-to-grow <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/living-green/blogs/save-money/perennial-vegetables-460410\">perennial vegetable</a>, and it's available from the <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/eat-safe/winter-farmers-market-recipes\">winter farmers' market</a>, given it's tolerance for cold weather.</p>\n\n<p>One word of caution: In the Environmental Working Group's ranking of the <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/eat-safe/dirty-dozen-foods\">dirty dozen foods</a> with the highest pesticide residues, which is based on government testing data, <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/eat-safe/kale-pesticide-residue#fbIndex13\">kale and other dark leafy greens have often made the list</a>. So it's a good vegetable to buy organic.</p>\n\n<p>But how do you make it taste good? Some people can drink it <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/latest/kale-banana-mango-smoothie-0329#fbIndex8\">raw, in a smoothie</a>, but this article is not for them. Here are a few out-of-the-box ideas that go beyond <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/recipes/sauteed-kale-red-onion\">sauteing</a> or <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/recipes/chickpea-kale-tomato-salad-0911\">tossing in a salad</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Kale Chips</b>: Simply trim and toss kale greens with olive oil and salt, and bake until crisp for a unique snack, garnish or side dish. One big bunch makes enough <a href=\"http://www.delish.com/recipefinder/kale-chips-ghk0208?link=emb&dom=msn_health&src=syn&con=art&mag=tdg\">kale chips</a>for four people to taste, but expect the greens to cook down considerably.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soups</b>: Kale can be paired with other vegetables, especially potatoes, for a delicious soup. Try <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/recipes/potato-kale-soup-recipe\">peasant-style potato-kale soup</a> or <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/recipes/kale-soup-1201\">Curly Kale Soup</a>, found in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844831078/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedailygreen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1844831078\"><i>The Big Book of Quick & Healthy Recipes: 365 Delicious & Nutritious Meals in Under 30 Minutes</i></a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Kale-Stuffed Peppers</b>: Chef Louisa Shafia, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158008964X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thedailygreen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=158008964X\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Lucid Food</i></a>, mixes kale with tempeh, onions and spices for a full-flavored <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/recipes/stuffed-poblano-chile-peppers\">vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe</a> that can even be described \"meaty.\"</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-11-26T01:40:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"3826","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Shapley","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dshapley","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6648169","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/healthy-eating/eat-safe/winter-farmers-market-recipes\">How to Cook Bok Choy and 25 More Winter Farmers' Market Secrets</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/kale-recipes-1201\">3 Out-of-the-Box Ways to Make Kale Taste Good</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/fall-recipes-50092209\">25+ Fantastic Fall Recipes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/winter-recipes-50123008\">30+ Healthy Winter Recipes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/recipes/college-cooking-recipes\">3 Quick and Easy College Vegetarian Cooking Recipes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/healthy-homemade-pizza-recipes\">13 Healthy Homemade Pizza Recipes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/best-farmers-markets-0917\">12 of the Biggest (and Best) U.S. Farmers' Markets</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/kale-banana-mango-smoothie\">Raw Banana-Mango-Kale Smoothie</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/summer-recipes-50062409\">28 Delicious Summer Recipes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy-eating/eat-safe/chef-celebrity-recipes-50012710\">11 Delicious Recipes from 11 Celebrity Chefs</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-04T16:05:55.000Z","author_id":"5338","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"thedailygreen","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"The Daily Green","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/latest/kale-recipes-1201","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Want abs worthy of the silver screen?

The short answer: they don't disappoint.</p>\n<p>Built in 2008, Element Lexington is the only Starwood-owned and manager of the bunch; the others are franchises, but operate under the same guidelines to build and operate using non-toxic and local materials, and to operate using technology and practices that reduce both energy and water waste. The packaging is modern and comfortable--from dubbing the lobby a \"common space\" for communal breakfasts featuring more appealing light and organic yogurt-and-granola-type options than your typical Continental breakfast buffet, to the energy-saving but still gigantic TV offering on-demand movies in the midst of a room designed with a modern color palette and crisply drawn lines.</p>\n<p>Like any thoughtfully designed and built green building, you can get dizzy cataloging its attributes, from soy fill in the cushions to faucet aerators to cut water usage by a third. For guests some of the most appealing features include the availability of both recycling and compost bins, the filtered water on tap, the lack of chlorine in the pool (it's a <a href=\"http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/latest/natural-swimming-pools-460908\">natural salt pool</a>,) and the dishes and flatware in the kitchenette. For drivers of hybrid and electric cars, there are even prime reserved parking spaces.</p>\n<p>That's a glimpse of Element Lexington. Each Element hotel is different. The Element Times Square, for instance, offered a farmers market of sorts, so guests could order a cache of Vermont-grown vegetables. (While undoubtedly appealing for some travelers, I personally could not imagine staying in midtown Manhattan and not eating out at every opportunity.)</p>\n<p>Here's what is consistent about this hotel chain: You will get the feel of a modern boutique hotel and low-impact green design wrapped in the staffing and quality assurance that comes with staying with one of the world's largest hotel companies.</p>\n<p>Therein also lies my one disappointment. There's nothing bad to say about the Element hotel chain. So why isn't Starwood making green design a feature of <em>all</em> it's hotel chains, which also include the Sheraton, St. Regis, Le M&#233;ridien, W, Westin, Four Points and Aloft brands? In all, there are 1,076 Starwood-branded hotels, with over 315,000 rooms.</p>\n<p>The Element brand is a great option for the green consumer, but we would really celebrate if the Element brand was less a green feather in Starwood's cap than an incubator used to test green practices and designs to be rolled out at its sister brands across the world.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-11-05T00:10:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Shapley","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dshapley","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6634874","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/environmental-news/greenest-cities-47052901\">The Greenest U.S. Cities (Are Not What You Think)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living-green/greenest-cities-2011\">Greenest City Nominees</a><br>\n<a href=\"/environmental-news/greenest-oil-companies-460409\">BP as Greenest Oil Company?

Chew it up</h2>\n<p>\"All fat stored in your body comes from food,\" says David McCarthy, professor of nutrition and health at London Metropolitan University. <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/lose-weight/fast-tips/the-100-greatest-weight-loss-tips-532562?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">Good digestion helps you process fat</a>, and this starts with saliva, so work on your mastication.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight it</strong> Add lemon juice to water, tea, yoghurt and salads. It triggers saliva production and helps break down lipids.</p>\n<h2>2. Gut reaction</h2>\n<p>When full, your stomach empties into the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. &#147;Here bile is released, making fat easier to absorb,&#148; says McCarthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight it</strong> Add vinegar to fatty foods. Research in <em>The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry</em> found that vinegar increases the production of stomach acids, reducing your body&#146;s fat storage by up to 10%.</p>\n<h2>3. Fat transformation</h2>\n<p>&#147;Your pancreas releases the enzymes that break down fat,&#148; says McCarthy. It&#146;s then converted into fat globules called chylomicrons which are transported in your bloodstream.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight it</strong> <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/superfoods/guide-to-superfoods-blueberries?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">Gorge on blueberries</a>. Studies have demonstrated that this potent fruit can reduce chylomicrons by 73%.</p>\n<h2>4. In the blood</h2>\n<p>&#147;Chylomicrons circulate in the blood until they are taken up by fat-storing cells called adipose tissue,\" says McCarthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight it</strong> Switch from white to brown sugar. The molasses in brown sugar are high in polyphenols, which reduce this tissue.</p>\n<h2>5. The soft cell</h2>\n<p>The adipose tissue is broken down by enzymes into fatty acids, which are then taken up by the fat cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight it</strong> Lower your carb intake to 43% of your daily calorie allowance. Research by The Endocrine Society found this can reduce fat levels by 11%.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><em>Words: Wesley Doyle.

You, <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/lose-weight/healthy-delicious/lose-weight-without-eating-less?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">in pursuit of a leaner physique</a>, resolve not to eat it. The doughnut doesn&#8217;t budge and nor do you; it&#8217;s a sprinkle-topped Mexican stand-off loaded with jam and 300 calories. Whether you win or lose the battle is a simple matter of willpower.</p>\n<p>Now, before you give in to the jam-splattered conclusion, know this: willpower can be trained. Just like a bicep, your resolve gets fatigued as you use it and gets stronger if you exercise it properly. Research into self-control shows that if you exercise discipline to meet one goal, you will be mentally fitter to take on the next.</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\">Warm up your willpower</span></strong></em> <br /><em><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\">Take a small goal that you can train in a specific situation. For example, every time you pick up <em>Men's Health</em>, read it whilst holding a good seated posture. This has nothing to do with weight loss but, over time, it builds up your mental reserve of willpower.</span></em></p>\n<p>Halfway through a gruelling summer diet, exercise and detox regime, most people could use that extra self-will. &#8220;One of the biggest mistakes people make is that they pursue more than one goal simultaneously,&#8221; says John Tierney, co-author of <em>Willpower: Rediscovering Our Greatest Strength</em>. &#8220;We try to lose weight at the same time as quitting cigarettes. But these things draw on the same limited resource of willpower in your body.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\">Pick one goal</span></strong></em> <br /><em><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\">Cut out alcohol, <em>or</em> reduce your carb intake, <em>or</em> stop swearing. Attempt them all and you're unlikely to achieve any.</span></em></p>\n<h2>Success tastes sweet</h2>\n<p>Willpower is not hard-wired into your personality. In fact, it ebbs and flows thanks to glucose. Your body converts food into this simple sugar and your brain uses it when you concentrate and make choices. When glucose levels are low, you&#8217;re more likely to give in to temptation. And it&#8217;s not just doughnuts, but vices of all kinds: cigarettes, sex, the internet, yawning in a meeting, rolling your eyes at your wife. Anything you have to fight the urge to do.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons shedding a stone or two is difficult is that the willpower to achieve long-term goals shares the same store of glucose as smaller, everyday goals.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\"><em><strong>Lose weight right now</strong></em></span> <br /><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\"><em>\"I will cut out 250 calories today\" works better than \"I'll lose 10lb by April\". Make your goals immediate, specific and achievable, and the end results will happen.</em></span></p>\n<p>Research by Dr Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University and <em>Willpower&#8217;s</em> co-author, found that people actively resist temptation for three to four hours every day. &#8220;When willpower is low, people abandon long-term goals and operate on a short-term focus,&#8221; Baumeister says.</p>\n<p>Even simple decision-making drains your willpower. If you make lots of little choices <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/lose-weight/burn-fat/beat-your-weight-loss-obstacles?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">ahead of meal-time</a> &#8211; comparing calories or deciding where to eat &#8211; you suffer from 'decision fatigue', leaving you weaker in the face of temptation two hours later. Your willpower muscle gets overworked and tired, leaving nothing in the tank to fight the next lure.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\"><em><strong>Have a to-don't list ready</strong></em></span> <br /><em><span style=\"color: #eb5c00;\">Decide ahead of time what you're not going to do in specific scenarios, such as \"I am not going to have mini pizzas at the buffet.\" It pre-programs your willpower for tempting situations.</span></em></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-05T06:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11281","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6648501","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/healthy/how-to-boost-your-willpower\">How to boost your willpower </a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/defeat-temptation-255645\">Defeat temptation </a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/dan-rookwood-cover-model-training-blog-15\">How to resist temptation </a><br>\n<a href=\"/lose-weight/resist-temptation-202054\">Resist temptation </a><br>\n<a href=\"/lose-weight/fat-burners-finale-2012\">The MH fat-burners finale 2012</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/andrew-baggaley-interview\">MH Grill: Andrew Baggaley</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/kickstart-your-motivation\">Kickstart your motivation </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/sports-training/maximise-your-motivation-289085\">Maximise your motivation </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/defeat-temptation-at-christmas-time-254670\">Defeat temptation at Christmas time</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/beat-stress-with-your-calves\">Beat stress with your calves</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"march '12 p79","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:33:11.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-30T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/brain-training/how-to-boost-your-willpower","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"10 tips that will help you get over a devastating breakup.","site_id":"2","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"exes, getting back together, relationships, breakups, the breakup bible","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"10 Things You Must Do After a Breakup","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-02-04T19:56:38.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/advice/tips/women-better-than-men-things","link_text":"12 Things Women Do Better Than Men"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/dating-advice/things-guys-are-insecure-about","link_text":"8 Secret Guy Insecurities"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips-moves/lies-men-tell-before-sex","link_text":"12 Lies Men Tell Before Sex"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/advice/health/foods-that-make-you-sexy","link_text":"9 Foods That Make You Even Sexier"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips-moves/how-to-turn-him-on","link_text":"30 Ways to Turn Him On"},{"auto_generated":"0","syndication_flag":"1","protected":"1","url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/advice/health/surprising-weight-loss-tricks","link_text":"10 Surprising Weight-Loss Tricks"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebrity/exclusive/How-to-Get-Over-Him-The-No-BS-Guide","link_text":"How to Get Over Him: The No B.S.

In today&#146;s economic landscape making the right impression will help you get ahead of the competition. So when it comes to that job interview, first day or pay review, you need to make sure you look the part in order to get the part you want. </p>\n\n<p>You&#146;re never buying &#145;just another suit&#146;. Your everyday business uniform could be the difference between sealing that big deal, scoring a pay rise, or securing your dream job. Lest there&#146;s any doubt: the psychological and financial advantages to be accrued by dressing well are not to be scoffed at.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.udeshi.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Oscar Udeshi</a>, a former City man turned menswear designer, has an insider&#146;s insight into the importance of image in business. &#147;If your appearance doesn&#146;t send out the right message, there can be a lack of trust,&#148; he says. Your look has to communicate that you are trustworthy, responsible, sincere and likeable, particularly at an interview.</p>\n\n<p>And your first day in a new job presents another conundrum: how will you look impressive while still fitting in? &#147;You don&#146;t want to go over the top, but you don&#146;t want to be mistaken for the post boy either,&#148; says Udeshi. So turn up looking smart, but safely outside the realms of sartorial excess.</p>\n\n<p>Once you&#146;ve put your stamp on the company, it&#146;s time to ask for a pay rise. Looking the part puts you on the front foot. A study published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> found attractive communicators were more persuasive than average looking ones &#150; so the better you look, the better your chances of getting the rise you&#146;re after.</p>\n\n<p>An economic downturn can be fortuitous for some: a reduced workforce leaves greater scope for good people to rise faster. At this stage, you&#146;d do well to concentrate on the details of your outfit, to set you apart from your colleagues and other candidates &#150; and we&#146;ll show you exactly what to focus on.</p>\n\n<p>And having been granted the corner office, your PA and company equity, finally getting a seat on the board is not an excuse to let your image slip. Your look needs to be inspirational without being pompous &#150; business is hardly booming, remember? So quality of fabrics and materials is key.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever level you&#146;re at, underestimate the importance of your image at your peril. The wrong outfit can short-sell your talent, but the right one can leverage your potential many times over. Allow <em>MH</em> to show you how to do it in fine style.</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-08-19T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6638546","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/style/how-to-look-the-business-at-work\">How to look the business at work </a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/five-ways-to-recession-proof-your-business-330706\">Five ways to recession proof your business </a><br>\n<a href=\"/style/the-best-holiday-clothes\">The perfect abroadrobe: What to wear on holiday</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/q-i-know-i-should-wear-sun-cream-but-i-never-remember-until-the-damage-is-done-whats-the-best-way-to-cool-sunburn-10084\">Q I know I should wear sun cream, but I never remember until the damage is done.

I hear the mailbox creak open outside and hop up to retrieve its contents. Bills. More bills. And my yearly water report. I pop open the circle of plastic tape and read the results: no violations. My water is in compliance with every drinking-water standard regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Not that it's perfect: Barium, chromium, copper, lead, nitrate, and other chemicals, as well as E. coli (<i>E. coli!?</i>), have been detected over the past year.</p>\n<p>In fact, those contaminants are proverbial drops in the bucket. Antibiotics, hormones, a cancer drug, a chemical found in gasoline, antiseizure medication...research shows that hundreds of unregulated contaminants may be flowing from my tap &#151; largely invisible, tasteless, and undetectable. They won't be on my water report (or yours) because they are not on the government's list of contaminants to monitor. And although they're at low levels, no one knows how dangerous they might be when they're all mixed together in the water supply and consumed over a lifetime. The government has frequently been criticized for being too lax about chemicals, but last August, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office issued a report urging the EPA to coordinate research on what contaminants like these could be doing to us.</p>\n<p>That's why, to help you take matters into your own hands, Good Housekeeping partnered with the Arizona Laboratory for Emerging Contaminants at the University of Arizona, one of the world's leading labs for study of unregulated chemicals. Together with the GH Research Institute, the lab performed extensive testing &#151; the first-ever such analysis &#151; to see whether everyday filters, like the ones in water pitchers and refrigerators, can remove some of these chemicals. GH also joined forces with the Water Sciences Laboratory at the University of Nebraska in order to test home contaminant-detection kits. </p>\n<p>Here's what you need to know, plus smart, easy ways to protect your family.</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>What's (Sort of) Regulated</b></p>\n<p>By law, your local water system must test municipal drinking water for some 90 substances and organisms &#151; including copper, uranium, and lead &#151; and report whether any have been found and at what levels, as well as whether any exceed federally mandated Maximum Contaminant Levels &#151; MCLs (For information on how to read your water report, pick up a copy of the March 2012 issue of Good Housekeeping). And if the levels are too high? Then, under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and Amendments, your town is supposed to take measures to lower them.</p>\n<p>Yet in fiscal year 2010 (the latest data available), 10% of all community water systems &#151; serving more than 23 million people &#151; sold water to consumers that violated at least one health-based EPA standard. Many of those violations were due to elevated levels of coliform bacteria, an indicator of how well a treatment plant is (or isn't) cleaning the water. When coliform levels are high, it can mean the water isn't being adequately disinfected &#151; and other bacteria, such as E. coli, could well be thriving, too. The treatment plant must then do further testing for the more dangerous bacteria, including those that cause GI illnesses (diarrhea, vomiting), which can be particularly risky for small children and the elderly. </p>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/womens-health/water-safety-2\" target=\"_blank\">Next: The violations we know about, and the ones we don't</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"939579","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/woman-drinking-water-sm-MpfFor-17891361.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Gorman","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"akwan","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641959","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/water-safety\">Is Your Tap Water Safe ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/fit-fresh-livpure-water-bottle-620\">Fit &amp; Fresh LivPure Water Bottle</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/best-reusable-water-bottles\">Best Reusable Water Bottles</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/water-tests\">Home Water Tests: The Claims, The Truth</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/best-reusable-water-bottle-reviews\">Reusable Water Bottles Tested</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/stains-glue-may07\">Stain Buster &mdash; Glue, Water -Based Craft</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/bobble-water-bottle-280\">Bobble Water Bottle</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/nutrition/drink-enough-water-0307\">Are You Drinking Enough Water ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/get-rid-of-well-water-stains\">Get Rid of Well-Water Stains</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/how-to-keep-food-safe\">Why Your Food Isn't Safe </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:32:22.000Z","author_id":"10931","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/womens-health/water-safety","issue_date":"March 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"To shed serious pounds you need to crank up your training to 11.

Or to believe that, even if it were a possibility, they wouldn&#146;t want it. Call it arrogance. Or anxiety, maybe.</p>\n<p>Recent biomedical advancements in the research spheres of stem cells, molecular repair, cloning, synthetic organs and cybernetics are already improving people&#146;s life expectancy. Now scientists are daring to believe those developments could soon stop ageing decisively. Life extension. The end of death, bar fatal trauma.</p>\n<p>The initial therapies are the hard bit: tissue engineering (creating organs in a lab and transplanting them), stem cell therapy (injecting &#145;repair&#146; cells into the patient) and molecular regenerative medicine (repairing cells within the body). Current thinking is that there&#146;s a 50% chance of getting it all done within 25 years.</p>\n<p>Those therapies would be applied to middle-aged people, whose bodies haven&#146;t suffered any serious damage. It would grant another 30 years of healthy life. Then when the patient comes back after 30 years the new therapies would have improved. The patient would be rejuvenated for longer. Therapies would improve again. The patient would not age. In the business of beating death, this is known as &#145;longevity escape velocity&#146;.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#146;t escape and fatal trauma shuts the gate before we&#146;ve all bolted, it&#146;s not the end. You can come back. In the past two years, improved availability of cryonic techniques have sparked a price-war between clinics all over the world. From those in the US offering eternal-life insurance for $30 (&#163;20) a month, all the way to a centre outside Moscow where they&#146;ll preserve your head for as little as &#163;6,000, coming back from the beyond is suddenly far less far-fetched. However much or little you pay, the promise is the same &#150; suspension of your being until a time when death isn&#146;t death any more.</p>\n<p>We&#146;re used to death, though. It&#146;s &#145;just a part of life&#146;. Death has a psychological stranglehold over us; we&#146;ve convinced ourselves it&#146;s good because we think we can&#146;t do anything about it. We&#146;re afraid of immortality because it&#146;s unfamiliar. We come up with &#145;crazy&#146; reasons why it would be bad. We say we&#146;d be bored; there&#146;d be too many of us; dictators would terrorise forever. We want death instead.</p>\n<p>But immortality is too important to sweep under the exisistential carpet. After all, billions of lives are at stake. Your life is at stake. Mine is too. For me &#150; stocky, a history of early strokes in the family, atheist &#150; death is increasingly real and terrifying. The scientists are claiming that it needn&#146;t be the former; the philosophers say the latter shouldn&#146;t worry you. Who should you believe? If the scientists are right, why don&#146;t we embrace them as the saviours of a world&#146;s worth of existences? Are we more scared of their eternal life than our own death? It&#146;s immortalists vs deathists. Whose side are you on?</p>\n<h2>Life as we know it</h2>\n<p>Imagine if it worked. Life becomes a cruise instead of a race. No panic over ageing (300 is the new 30) and no need to stress with an eternity of tomorrows. It would be glorious, but we don&#146;t want it.</p>\n<p>To find out why, I decided to start as close to my home in the North East of England as possible: Ian Ground, senior philosophy lecturer at Sunderland University&#146;s Centre for Lifelong Learning. We sit down in his office. He says he just gave a lecture on immortality and the arguments are fresh in his mind. Perfect. He says the world would become a worse place. The population would rise dramatically and basic resources would be scarce. Inequalities would increase. Dictators would live indefinitely (the Church of England&#146;s medical ethics advisor also uses the same argument, saying mortality is good because it limits &#147;the amount of evil&#148; a person can do). And, of course, we&#146;d be old.</p>\n<p>&#147;Typically people get more conservative as they get older,&#148; says Ground. &#147;They could become resistant to change, so what&#146;s going to happen to innovation? There are questions about society stagnating. Most of us wouldn&#146;t want the world to be run by our grandfathers.&#148;</p>\n<p>Then come problems for the individual. Things don&#146;t get any perkier.</p>\n<p>&#147;Scientists think we can go on discovering things about the universe forever,&#148; he continues. &#147;Maybe we can, but what we aren&#146;t envisaging is just becoming knowledge-acquiring machines for the rest of our lives. We need feelings and relationships, not just work.</p>\n<p>&#147;We&#146;re used to the idea of birth, growth and development, a period of maturity, gradual tailing off, and hopefully a dignified retirement and death. We don&#146;t know what happens if we plateau. We have no idea whether the human mind can survive that. It may be that we just get profoundly bored.&#148;</p>\n<p><br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/dummy-noma-bar.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2><br />Never-ending story</h2>\n<p>Boredom is a frequent fear with deathists. But would you get bored? Surely life would become infinitely more interesting? Every decade you could have a gap year.</p>\n<p>You&#146;d have a list of ex-girlfriends like the <em>Domesday Book</em>. And if it got that bad, you could just throw in the towel. But journalist Bryan Appleyard, author of <em>How to Live Forever or Die Trying</em>, says <em>ennui</em> would set in.</p>\n<p>&#147;Some gerontologists say &#145;If you&#146;re bored why don&#146;t you learn quantum mechanics or learn to speak Arabic?&#146;&#148; he tells me. &#147;Well I don&#146;t want to learn Arabic. Just because I&#146;m 200 years old won&#146;t make me more keen on doing those things.</p>\n<p>&#147;I think there&#146;s a point that the immortalists don&#146;t understand, and it&#146;s that one exhausts one&#146;s own personality over a certain period. It&#146;s a weird idea that you would go on and on, still being interested in being yourself. I don&#146;t think anyone would. I think you&#146;d get excruciatingly bored of being yourself.&#148;</p>\n<p>If you want to know what living forever would be like, you talk to gerontologist Aubrey De Grey. He was the subject of a previous <em>MH</em> profile, detailing his first acts as the frontman of immortalism. Since then, De Grey has continued on in his self-propelled race towards reaching the &#145;longevity escape velocity&#146;.</p>\n<p>He suggests we meet over a beer but our schedules clash, so we arrange to speak on the phone. From internet videos I know he looks like a slacker Druid: long beard, jeans, trainers and crystal eyes.</p>\n<p>De Grey has an answer for Appleyard: &#147;Wouldn&#146;t it be boring? Wouldn&#146;t dictators live forever? I&#146;m not saying the reasons they give are stupid. I&#146;m just saying it&#146;s unbelievably absurd to raise them as objections to solving a rather major problem that we have today, namely the ill-health of old age.</p>\n<p>&#147;I don&#146;t want to be the sort of person who condemns humanity to an unnecessarily early death, just because I thought I knew what life would be like in the future.&#148;</p>\n<p>De Grey has a phenomenal brain. He studied computing science at Cambridge University and taught himself the science of ageing. Now he&#146;s researching regenerative medicines. He believes he will discover biological immortality before the white coats of the traditional scientific establishment. People believe him, enough to fund his laboratory in California.</p>\n<p>He tells me about the laboratory; about the mice; the cells and molecules; the rich backers (including Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal). He talks about his belief that someone alive today may live to be 1,000. You can laugh, but he&#146;s cleverer than you are.</p>\n<h2>The disposable body</h2>\n<p>&#147;Aubrey is a... very skilled showman.&#148; Tom Kirkwood runs the Institute for Ageing and Health in the western suburbs of Newcastle upon Tyne &#150; the biggest facility of its kind in Europe. Outside it&#146;s leafy and peaceful. Inside it&#146;s hard science. It&#146;s a pretty far cry from De Grey&#146;s sunny California base.</p>\n<p>Kirkwood is the dean of ageing. In 2001 he gave the Reith Lectures &#150; a renowned BBC radio series assessing the most vital contemporary issues of our time. In his lectures Kirkwood described how our (humanity&#146;s) life expectancy doubled over the past two centuries. We (scientists) did it mainly by defeating acute infectious diseases. Now ageing is our <em>be&#770;te noire</em>, bringing with it cancer, stroke and heart disease. If you live long enough, your chances of being struck down with any, or even all, of the above increase exponentially. Kirkwood teaches me about ageing as we drink tea.</p>\n<p>We are not programmed to age, he says. It&#146;s just a build-up of damage. Kirkwood published a famous theory around this: our bodies are able to repair themselves and avoid ageing, but they divert the energy towards reproduction. Historically we were likely to be eaten by badgers or crushed by a menhir long before ageing became relevant. Repair was pointless.</p>\n<p>He calls this the &#145;disposable soma&#146; theory. It was published in 1977, after he thought of it while having a bath (take note all those who hurry in the shower). Now he&#146;s spending his life learning how to stop the damage of ageing. It&#146;s a growing field and a complicated field. It&#146;s noteworthy that cancer gets a lot more investment and we (again, the scientists) haven&#146;t fixed that yet. Kirkwood is a lot less optimistic than De Grey.</p>\n<p>&#147;What Aubrey has done,&#148; he says, &#147;is to look at this from an engineering perspective. He&#146;s got a list of things he feels need to be fixed and he says, &#145;Right, we&#146;ll fix them and we&#146;ll all live for a thousand years.&#146;</p>\n<p>&#147;Well, in principle, who can argue with that? The reason I criticise him really very strongly, is he grossly distorts the scale of the scientific challenge and raises completely false expectations about what is likely to happen. And people get excited by it. I think that&#146;s wrong.&#148;</p>\n<p>Kirkwood is one of 28 genterologists who co-authored a paper critical of this approach in 2005. It claimed De Grey was in the &#147;realm of fantasy&#148;. They said ageing research is only just emerging from a reputation of quackery and beginning to be taken seriously. Put simply, they don&#146;t want De Grey&#146;s &#147;empty fantasies&#148; cocking things up.</p>\n<p>De Grey&#146;s retort was to quote Lord Kelvin from 1895: &#147;Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible&#148;. He went on to say that life extension is a form of engineering and its goals, methods and skills are different to those of science. He ended by saying, &#147;lives, lots of them, are at stake&#148;. Kirkwood still hasn&#146;t been persuaded.</p>\n<p>&#147;I work in mainstream biomedical research,&#148; he says, &#147;and these kinds of arguments discourage mainstream science from taking ageing as seriously as it needs to be taken. It&#146;s damaging to the interests of older people, so I feel very strongly that what he is doing is wrong.&#148;</p>\n<p>De Grey stands by his predictions. Kirkwood by his proof. But if immortality is just around the corner, who would want to miss it when it does come around? Stick it out long enough, and you could decide whether living forever is what you want with all the facts of immortality in front of you. There is already a way you can.</p>\n<h2>Frozen in time</h2>\n<p>In 1948, an American wrier named Robert Ettinger wrote a short story for a magazine. It was about a man who was revived after centuries of being frozen. In 1964 he wrote a book called <em>The Prospect of Immortality</em>. It's about freezing real people in the hope that future science will resurrect them. He writes about repair and rejuvenation, transplants and prostheses, organ culture and regeneration (De Grey is a great admirer). Three years after publishing the book, a retired psychology professor became the first cryonics patient. In 1976 Ettinger opened the Cryonics Institute in Michigan.</p>\n<p>When Ettinger died, aged 92, he became the 106th person to be frozen at the institute. Currently there are about 200 people frozen in various cryonics facilities around the world, mostly in America. De Grey is registered to be frozen at Alcor in Arizona. Adherents believe cold storage is preferable to the grave. It gives them hope of a wonderful afterlife: the future.</p>\n<p>I call Dr Brendan McCarthy, the medical ethics advisor for the Church of England, to ask if he has any objections to this &#145;afterlife&#146;. Would he want it? He says Christians have a better offer: life with God. I ask if he understands why some of us want immortality.</p>\n<p>&#147;I think some people believe that when their body stops functioning as a physical organism that&#146;s it, that&#146;s simply the end,&#148; he says. &#147;They have a desire to keep on living and do better things, but they believe there is nothing. And they fear that.&#148;</p>\n<h2>Your second coming</h2>\n<p>In the end, the entire subject of immortality is one of fear. We&#146;re scared both of terminal death and of endless life. Professor Nick Zangwill, a philosopher at Durham University, has the final word on why some of us are now increasingly desperate to live on. He&#146;s working late and scribbles some thoughts down on an email. What he says strikes to the very heart of the eternal question: &#147;One might feel disappointed with the life one&#146;s led, but clinging on to more isn&#146;t necessarily going to right that. I suppose one might have a chance to live the life one would like to have lived. But what you&#146;re really wanting is to live your life again but better. And that&#146;s impossible.&#148;</p>\n<p>The 101st patient at the Cryonics Institute was an 18-year-old boy. He suffered from depression and committed suicide in late 2010. After he died his parents signed him up for freezing. His body was packed in dried ice, put on a plane and taken to Michigan. Upon arrival he was stored in a cryostat, an 18-year-old-boy-sized thermos bottle full of liquid nitrogen.</p>\n<p>You can see why his parents did it. If you think immortality is impossible it&#146;s easy to dismiss. But if you believe? That&#146;s when you want it. That&#146;s when you hope. In a world where the logic of science is more quantifiable, more acceptable to our mindset than the promises of religion, hope is the new afterlife. The boy&#146;s parents hoped badly. They wanted him to have another chance, even if he didn&#146;t. <em>They</em> wanted another chance. Whether you believe an end to death is something you truly want or not, it&#146;s the same reason any of us want immortality: please, one more chance. Just give me more time.</p>\n<p><br /><em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Illustrations: Noma Bar; Words: Andrew Hankinson</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Follow

When Tulisa made a jibe about Dappy's new music video - she officially hates it - Dappy got a little upset...</p>\n<p>\"Now why would u say that,,,i cant believe u T...Why would u say this about my work..Just so u can keep cool with your xf job\"</p>\n<p>Oh Dappy. Dappy, Dappy, DAPPY! Never mention The X Factor. The comment about Tulisa's job clearly hit a nerve and the talent judge completely lost it, telling him that, one day, she would get him back into shape:</p>\n<p>\"@thedappy stop cussin peeps out 4 ratins! talent speaks 4 itself u little sh*t.Wen will u bloody learn!wen we unite Im gettin u back in shape... ur a talented little f*cker with to many issues!sort it out daps friggin sort it out!!!\"</p>\n<p>That would have been OUR cue to button that lip - Tulisa can be pretty feisty when she's angry, after all. But, judging from Dappy's latest tweet, this feud is FAR from over...</p>\n<div align=\"justify\">\n<p>\"Like i told u im just warming up..Its only right 1 of us tells it how it should be..#YgetFameThenChange\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>Yikes! We guess the pair didn't learn that airing your private battles in the Twittersphere is a pretty embarrassing idea when it comes to the morning after...<br /><br /><strong>2. </strong><strong>Diane Abbott</strong><br />When young writer Bim Adewunmi expressed her concern for the term 'black community' being used too loosely, we're sure she didn't expect to receive a tweet reply from MP Diane Abbott. Unfortunately for Ms. Abbott, her tweet&#160; that 'white people love playing divide and rule' caused uproar, which lead to her being ordered to apologise by her boss Labour leader Ed Milliband. Diane later said the tweet was taken out of context - whoops, better book yourself in for more media (and Twitter) training in the future, Diane&#8230; <br /><br /><strong>3. Jessica Wright</strong><br />TOWIE star Jessica Wright found herself trending on Twitter in December 2011 - for all the wrong reasons. When North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il died, Jessica gave her deep-felt condolences by tweeting 'Rest in peace.' We're pretty sure she didn't expect the backlash she was to receive - Kim Jong-il didn't go down as the most pleasant man in history, and poor Jessica clearly didn't do her research before tweeting &#8211; oops!<br /><br /><strong>4. Kim Kardashian</strong><br />When Kim took a quick Twitter photo of herself holding a cat by the scruff of its neck, she received tons of complaints. Many Twitter users were worried about the way Kim had held the cat, but she later said the cat's owner was present and she would never harm any animals. Phew! Be careful Kim, you don't want to get in any more trouble with animal protesters<br /><br /><strong>5. Ashton Kutcher</strong><br />2011 was a testing year for Ashton Kutcher. If the separation between him and his wife Demi Moore wasn't challenging enough, it appears managing his twitter account also proved to be difficult. Ashton received backlash after tweeting messages of support to football coach Joe Paterno, who had been accused of failing to act after being made aware of child abuse. As a result, Ashton Kutcher said he was letting his management take over his Twitter account. Erm, now that he's no longer tweeting sickly cute photos of him and Demi we think that sounds like a pretty good idea&#8230;<br /><br /><strong>6. Russell Brand</strong><br />Russell Brand made the awful mistake of tweeting a photo of his ex-wife Katy Perry - with no makeup on. Yikes! He said it was an innocent mistake and that he never intended to publish to his Twitter account - followed by millions. Was this the real reason why the marriage failed?<br /><br /><strong>7. Piers Morgan</strong><br />Remember the famous gagging order that prevented anyone from saying which 'high profile footballer' was having an affair? Well Piers Morgan ignored that rule, and revealed the man in question was Ryan Giggs. Oops! But we all knew anyway, didn't we?<br /><br /><strong>8. Charlie Sheen</strong><br />Charlie Sheen made the ultimate Twitter mistake of direct messaging his mobile number to Justin Bieber - only for it to end up on his timeline. It was no surprise that Charlie's phone was ringing off the hook for days afterwards&#8230;<br /><br /><strong>9. Chris Brown<br /></strong>When Chris Brown picked up a Grammy this year, following his three year ban after his assault on ex-girlfriend Rihanna, not everyone was all too happy about it. Rather than sit back and let the critics run their course, Chris Brown decided to respond in the only way he knew how: \"HATE ALL YOU WANT BECUZ I GOT A GRAMMY Now! That's the ultimate F**K OFF!\" Unsurprisingly, the public and press didn't respond too well to that little outburst...<br /><br /><strong>10. Rihanna</strong><br />Rihanna is known for spending an awful lot of her free time of Twitter, and even sends occasional tweets to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown. But she may have gone a tweet too far when she wrote cryptic messages soon after Chris Brown posted a pic of him and his new girlfriend - suggesting a certain someone is lying to their girlfriend while laying with her. Oh no she didn't? Oh yes, she did! <br /><br /></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-07-04T09:07:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"18771","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Awoyera","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-ksdray","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6633996","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/celebs/best-ten-celebrity-twitter-blunders-lifestyle\">Top 10 celebrity Twitter blunders </a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebs/ashton-kiutcher-buys-girlfriend-mila-kunis-extravagant-present\">Ashton Kutcher buys Mila Kunis a $5000 phone case</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/ashton-and-mila-plan-to-buy-puppy-together\">Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher plan to buy a puppy together -

In a spooning position (you're on the outside), ask her to raise her top knee and then penetrate her from behind. Not only does this involve little effort on her part, but the angle will stimulate her G-spot while you play with her clitoris. \"Because your chest will be hugging her back, you can coordinate your breathing and rhythm, and thus be lulled into a very gentle and intimate togetherness,\" says Agnes Beregzaszi, a Hungarian sex columnist.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Spain</h2>\n<p><strong>The Downward Dog</strong></p>\n<p>Okay hombre, time to bring out the Latin lover in you and stir her passion. Ask her to rest her chest on the bed, lifting her rear in the air. From your knees, enter her from behind. Since you're thrusting up just slightly, the bottom of your penis massages her vaginal wall right where her G-spot is located. Bonus: \"This position lengthens her vaginal wall,\" says Pedro Otero, a sexologist in Spain, \"which in turn tightens her around your penis and makes you feel bigger to her.\"</p>\n\n\n<h2>India</h2>\n<p><strong>The Fusion</strong></p>\n<p>Sit on the bed or floor with your legs in front of you. Lean back and support yourself with your arms. Ask her to sit facing you and lower herself onto your penis while she leans back and supports her body with her arms. Her knees should be bent and near your shoulders. \"The union of sexual organs is visible to both partners,\" says Dr Mahinder Watsa, a sex therapist in India. \"That translates into an increase in overall sexual excitement.\"</p>\n\n\n<h2>Brazil</h2>\n<p><strong>The Amazon</strong></p>\n<p>Lie on your back and bring your knees towards your chest. Ask her to squat down on your erection, facing you, one foot on each side of your abdomen and her thighs resting on yours. Then, wrap your legs around her waist. \"This is a fantastic position for women who don't have strong enough quads to be on top for a long time,\" says Laura Muller, a sex advisor in Brazil. \"It allows the woman to control penetration while going at her own pace. It also leaves a hand free to caress her clitoris.\"</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p><font size=\"1\">Words: Laura Ongaro\n<br />Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\"

on it</h2>\n\n<p>Your bed is a weight&#150;loss tool. No, not like that, Casanova. We're talking about sleep. Those who get four hours kip eat 263 more calories each day than those who sleep for the recommended eight. Lack of Zzzs spikes your hunger hormones, found a study by New York's Obesity Nutrition Research Centre.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Get milk</h2>\n\n<p>To specifically target belly fat, eat a high-protein, low&#150;carb and calorie&#150;light diet in which the majority of your proteins come from dairy, says the <em>Journal of Nutrition</em>. \"Increasing calcium and protein in your diet encourages fat loss from the worst storage area in your body &#150; your belly,\" says study author Andrea Josse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get fresh</h2>\n\n<p>Pollution could be giving you a gut. Researchers at Ohio State University found exposure to dirty air leads to more abdominal fat than breathing fresh air. Pollutants may trigger an increase in fat cells, say the scientists, so wear a cycling mask when commuting in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block out burns</h2>\n\n<p>If you drink a strong coffee before training, you'll be able to work harder and longer, found scientists at the University of Louisiana. \"Caffeine blocks some of the pain receptors in your muscles,\" says lead researcher Dr David Bellar. He suggests that caffeine is most effective when drunk 45 minutes before you hit the weights. Gingerbread latte is unlikely to have the same effects, however.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Flex your imagination</h2>\n\n<p>When the going gets tough, think of a previous sporting victory. In a new British study, men who recalled a previously energising activity while cycling had more fun and felt more revitalised than those who didn&#146;t. \"Imagining an action rouses the same areas of the brain as performing it,\" says study author Dr Damian Stanley.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Build tension</h2>\n\n<p>In the world of abs, resistance is not futile. In fact, it's essential. \"When doing abs exercises where you raise your legs, such as hanging leg raises, make sure you don't let your legs return to 180 degrees,\" says strength coach Mark Coles. \"This keeps the tension on them, working your abs.\"</p>\n\n\n<h2>Choose wisely</h2>\n\n<p>Protein shakes can help you burn fat as well as build muscle. A new Swiss study found that casein is better than whey because you digest it slower. If you prefer whey, mix it with milk (80% of milk&#146;s protein is casein).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Get constantly evolving workout and nutrition plans personalised for your specific needs and training

So anytime I knew she was gonna come home, he hid under the bed and then as soon as she was in her room, I knew it was safe and he would jump out the window. Yes, from the 2nd storey, so that's my big secret. Bad, bad girl. </p>","transcript_link":""}],"seo_links":[{"__total_count__":1,"seo_title":"Trending Topics","links":[{"__total_count__":4,"open_new_window":"No","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com/women/me-in-my-place/joanna-krupa-pictures-2012","link_title":"Joanna Krupa RHOM"},{"__total_count__":4,"open_new_window":"No","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com/women/best-sex-positions","link_title":"Best Sex Tips and Positions"},{"__total_count__":4,"open_new_window":"No","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com/women/sex/finding-new-g-spot-0509","link_title":"Find the G Spot"},{"__total_count__":4,"open_new_window":"No","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com/women/sex/oral-sex-advice-6148501","link_title":"Oral Sex Tips and Advice"}]}],"seo_embedded_links":[{"embedded_links":[{"__total_count__":2,"open_new_window":"Yes","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com/women/me-in-my-place/joanna-krupa-pictures-2012","link_title":"Joanna Krupa"},{"__total_count__":2,"open_new_window":"Yes","link_url":"http://www.esquire.com","link_title":"Beautiful Women"}],"__total_count__":1,"embed_btn_title":""}],"facebook_embed":[{"__total_count__":1,"embed_title":"","embed_link":""}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite -

sports</strong> Swimming, surfing, cricket and all sports that involve throwing</p>\n\n<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>The shoulder joint is stabilised by the rotator cuff, which is made up of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor. These form a 'cuff' around the ball of the shoulder joint to prevent too much joint movement. Tendonitis (also known as rotator cuff tendonitis or impingement syndrome) is when the tendons of these muscles are overused and inflamed.</p>\n\n<h2>How you damage it</h2>\n<p>The most common causes are bad movement techniques and poor form when lifting weights; overuse of the shoulder joint; or muscular imbalances in one of the four muscles. This happens a lot in sports where the shoulder is lifted overhead repeatedly. Many muscular forces work around the shoulder, so tendonitis occurs if any are unbalanced in strength or length.</p>\n\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<p>A sharp pain at the top of the shoulder when you lift your arm overhead during sport, or a dull ache behind your shoulder after sport. You may hear a pop or click. In chronic cases the rotator cuff can tear, necessitating surgery.</p>\n\n<h2>Fix it</h2>\n<p>Use the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and an anti-inflammatory gel (such as <a href=\"http://www.wellbeing-uk.com/ItemInformation.aspx?ItemCode=PE01\" target=\"_blank\">Pernaton</a>) over the affected area for the first 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Shoulder tendonitis tends to re-occur so if it won't respond to RICE and continues for more than two weeks, see a physio for stabilisation exercises and specialist care. If you were hit on the arm and can't lift it more than 90 degrees, you may have a rotator-cuff tear. Seek immediate help from your doctor or local A&E.</p>\n\n<h2>How long you&#146;ll be out</h2>\n<p>If properly treated, you shouldn't be crocked for more than 14 days. In mild cases, with proper care, you might not have to stop sport at all, but simply change your training techniques or reduce the time spent playing. The rule is, if the pain is so bad you have to stop playing then rest until it heals. But if you only feel pain after sport, use RICE after each session, stretch and see a physio.</p>\n\n<h2>Prevent it</h2>\n<p>Stretch your lats and chest during warm-ups and cool-downs. In the gym, work on shoulder stabilisers, such as your traps, and during all upper-body training, keep your shoulders back and down during reps to build shoulder stability. If you swim or surf, remember to stretch your lats, especially during cool-downs.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><font size=\"1\">Words: Mike Squirrell</font></em></p>\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on

Set the bar</h2>\n\n<p>Turn your door frame into a multi-gym. Pull-up bars are great for performing stabilising moves. Hold the bar in either an over- or under-hand grip, let your body hang, then raise your knees and tuck them to your chest. Tense your stomach, and don't let go.\n<br /><strong>York Doorway Chinning Bar, &#163;16, <a href=\"http://dolphinfitness.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">dolphinfitness.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<h2>2. Get on track</h2>\n\n<p>Your cheapest tool for stripping away that flabby exterior is the great outdoors. To get more from your run, wear split-toe shoes, which allow greater traction from your big toe. You'll run further and longer, torching even more fat.\n<br /><strong>Brooks PureCadence, &#163;100, <a href=\"http://brooksrunning.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">brooksrunning.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<h2>3. Take your medicine</h2>\n\n<p>Med balls can be thrown, twisted, lifted and lowered to add weight to your standard routine. Try this: in a sit-up position, hold the ball in front of you. Twist your trunk to the left, then the right. Repeat for solid obliques.\n<br /><strong>66Fit Double-Handle Medicine Ball, &#163;41, <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">amazon.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>4. Dial it up</h2>\n\n<p>These smart dumbbells deliver a range of weights from 2-32.5kg at the twist of a dial, so you can tweak the weight in stages. Perform a squat holding the dumbbell at chest height and then explode upwards, pressing the dumbbell above you.\n<br /><strong>York Dial Tech Dumbbells and Stand, &#163;340, <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">amazon.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>5. Get in the swing of it</h2>\n\n<p>All PTs champion the kettlebells for their core-sculpting ability. Perform a kettlebell swing: keep your back straight, hold it between your legs, then swing your hips (controlling with your abs) until it reaches eye level.\n<br /><strong>Bodymax Vinyl Kettlebell, &#163;21, <a href=\"http://powerhouse-fitness.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">powerhouse-fitness.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<h2>6. Hang tough</h2>\n\n<p>Created by a taekwondo champion, the TRX trainer forces you to use your core strength to stabilise during every move. Attach one end to a sturdy support and perform four sets of 15 over-the-shoulder chops. Then have a lie-down.\n<br /><strong>TRX Rip Trainer, &#163;150, <a href=\"http://trxfitness.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">trxfitness.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><font size=\"1\"><br />Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-05-18T06:29:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11281","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6637905","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/living/three-pieces-of-gym-equipment\">Three pieces of gym equipment you should use</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/argos-home-gym-equipment\">Brilliant home gym equipment from Argos</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/huge-muscle-gains\">Make huge muscle gains with one gym session per week</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/the-best-equipment-for-six-pack\">The ultimate six-pack-sculpting gear</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/equipment-free-sixpack-workout\">The ultimate equipment -free six-pack workout</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/10-gym-free-workouts\">10 gym -free workouts you must try</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/get-big/build-your-own-gym-116071\">Build your own gym </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/a-very-personal-trainer\">A very personal trainer </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/join-the-right-gym-9491\">Join the right gym </a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/pull-up-bar-moves\">Four pull-up bar moves you must try</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"jan/feb '12 supplement - beginner's 6-pack guide p38","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:32:13.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/living/gear/the-best-equipment-for-six-pack","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The deadlift is the most basic of all strength-builders but is often done incorrectly.

Straighten your legs a bit (to take up the slack as you want tension on the bar at the start), squeeze your glutes, tighten your shoulder blades and pull in your lower abs. Then straighten your legs by imagining you're pushing your feet through the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Continue a smooth movement as you stand up, straightening the rest of your body using the driving force of your glutes. Finish in an upright position with your shoulders back and down and your lower back still flat. Throughout this whole move, the bar should stay in contact with your skin.</p>\n\n<p>For the lowering stage, slide the bar down your thigh and shins to the floor. This stage isn't necessarily the exact reverse of the raising stage as your purpose is simply to the get the bar back on the floor safely.</p>\n\n<h3>Perfect form</h3>\n<p><strong>Your back</strong> It's vital to maintain a straight back throughout the entire movement. Do this by forcing your gluteals out and tensing them. Your glutes and thighs will carry the highest workload, so concentrate on working them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your feet</strong> Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, pressing down on the floor to provide a stable platform from which your glutes can work as prime movers.</p> \n\n<p><strong>Your trunk and hips</strong> These should remain at or near the same angle. This is critical as getting this wrong causes more injuries than any other technical error in this exercise. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Your neck</strong> Keep a still, slightly upward-facing neck throughout the movement. Thrusting your chin forward will help. Fix your vision on a point and keep your head facing forward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your shoulders</strong> Squeeze your shoulder blades together.

Nervous about radical change? Then think smaller, says Garrison: \"You can stick with your favorite style, but update it in little ways.\" The trick is to work with a stylist who focuses on three key factors: your bone structure, hair texture, and preferred maintenance level (how much time you're willing to spend on daily styling).

you&#146;re in marriage counseling, chances are you and your husband are doing most of the talking. But thanks to years of experience, your therapist has plenty of advice that she&#146;d like to share with you, too. Read on to get expert insight on making the most of your sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>1. I can tell pretty quickly if your marriage is</strong><strong> going to last.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Within a few sessions I can generally make an educated guess about the future of your relationship,&#148; says Bree Maresca-Kramer, relationship counselor and author of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=it%27s+that+simple!+book&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=14892510733462022393&sa=X&ei=ROsNT7DJK6LV0QGdw9XVBQ&ved=0CFIQ8wIwCA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>It&#146;s That Simple!</em></a> &#147;A clear sign that it won&#146;t: One or both of you has emotionally checked out and is unwilling to take any responsibility for your problems.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>2. If you want a pity party, go elsewhere.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Women are always surprised that I don&#146;t seem outraged or upset by what they&#146;re telling me,&#148; says Joyce Morley, EdD, a marriage and family therapist in Decatur, Georgia. &#147;While I understand your feelings, I&#146;m not going to sit here and cry with you. It&#146;s not my job to be emotional. It&#146;s my job to help make your marriage better.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Learn to listen</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#147;Women can be so focused on trying to win that they forget to listen&#151;that&#146;s one of the biggest problems couples bring to therapy,&#148; says Dr. Morley. &#147;Women typically can&#146;t stop talking until they feel they&#146;ve proved their point. But men see counseling as an opportunity to finally speak. And when they do, wives are often shocked to hear what they have to say.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Give yourself a break</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#147;Men don&#146;t beat themselves up nearly as much as women do when they&#146;ve done something wrong in a relationship,&#148; says Dr. Morley. &#147;So if you&#146;ve messed up, accept responsibility and then quit kicking yourself over it.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Go ahead, argue.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;It allows me to see the real dynamic between the two of you,&#148; says Maresca-Kramer. &#147;I can then use that fight to help you gain a better understanding of each other&#146;s feelings.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>6. Let go of the past.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;In an argument, stick to the topic at hand,&#148; says Michelle, a relationship counselor in St. Louis. &#147;When you bring up stuff your husband did months, even years ago, I just want to say, &#145;Let it go already!&#146; You have to get over your past anger because forgiveness means moving on.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>7. I&#146;m not here to give you the answers.</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;A therapist will never tell you what to do,&#148; says Maresca-Kramer. &#147;It&#146;s counterproductive. You&#146;ll just become dependent on us instead of learning to make decisions for yourself.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-30T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"928532","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/dA/wedding-cake-topper-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Day Staff","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mmajor","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6637444","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-30T14:31:03.000Z","author_id":"11945","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-11T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/dating-marriage/marriage-counselor-wants-you-to-know","issue_date":"Woman's Day;

During walking and running, your hamstring lengthens, acting like a brake for the quads at the front of your thigh.</p>\n\n<h2>How you damage it</h2>\n<p>The three most common ways to injure your hamstring are:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> By tearing either end of the hamstring when you've been running at a steady pace and suddenly put in a burst of speed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2</strong> By tearing the middle of the hamstring. This often happens to long-distance runners, who tend to use small strides, shortening the muscle. If they then lengthen their stride to increase speed, the muscle can tear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3</strong> By tearing it when performing a high kick in football or martial arts.</p>\n\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\n<p>A ruptured hamstring makes a popping noise at the time of injury. Tears leave gaps in the muscle that you can feel. If you've only strained it, it will be painful when stretched or contracted, usually with a dark swelling behind the knee and tender points at either end of the muscle or in the muscle's 'belly'.</p>\n\n<h2>Fix it</h2>\n<p>If you feel a twinge when warming up, it's best to stop and stretch. If you feel your hamstring 'go', then stop what you're doing and head straight for the sidelines. If the injury proves to be minor, use the Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE) method for the first 48 hours, followed by two to three weeks of rest and stretching. Moderate hamstring injuries need physiotherapy and a programme of home exercise. Ruptures often require surgery.</p>\n\n<h2>How long you&#146;ll be out</h2>\n<p>Strains and tears: two to eight weeks of sofa time. Severe tears can mean three to four months out. Non-treatment results in a high likelihood of chronic re-injury. The 'hammie' injury can hound athletes for their entire careers if it's not allowed to heal the first time.</p>\n\n<h2>Prevent it</h2>\n<p>Hold stretches for 30 seconds, keeping the lower back straight to stretch both ends of the hamstring. Focus on quads and hips &#150; if they're tight, the hamstring is vulnerable. For supple muscles, stay hydrated.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><font size=\"1\">Words: Mike Squirrell</font></em></p>\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-04-27T06:31:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643960","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/fitness/injury-2-the-hamstring-tear\">Injury clinic: The hamstring tear </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/Protect-your-hamstring-with-Yoga\">Protect your hamstring with Yoga</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/solve-your-sports-injuries-330740\">Solve your sports injuries </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/no-stretch-hamstring-saver-278735\">No-stretch hamstring saver</a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/perfect-form-the-lying-leg-curl\">Perfect your form: the lying leg curl</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/steve-westlake-london-marathon-blog-4\">Steve Westlake&rsquo;s London Marathon training #4</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/ice-off-your-injuries-250605\">Ice off your injuries </a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/kneeling-hamstring-curl-9554\">Kneeling hamstring curl</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/injury-3-shoulder-tendonitis\">Injury clinic: Shoulder tendonitis</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/best-stretch-for-every-body-90211\">The best post-training stretches</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"April 05 p158","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-01-29T12:01:11.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/sports-injuries/injury-2-the-hamstring-tear","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Cosmo's UK festival guide 2012 -

always loved sweets, fast food and junk food. Basically, my eating habits have never been all that great. But I was able to offset them with exercise until after college, when I started working (and stopped moving). I knew I was getting fat, but I ignored it. When friends and family commented on my weight, I would hear what they said, feel bad and vow to myself to get back in shape. Yet I did nothing. As I got heavier, I was also diagnosed with depression and started taking medication.</p>\n<h3><strong>The turning point</strong></h3>\n<p>By the time 2009 came, I was over 300 pounds and eating was my only coping mechanism when tough things happened (like six months of unemployment). My self-esteem was at an all-time low, and I avoided social situations because I was embarrassed&#151;even walking through the parking lot to go to a movie was exhausting. At a routine medical checkup, I got more bad news: I was diagnosed with diabetes. When I went in for the follow-up, my doctor had already ordered medication, but I told him that I didn't want to take it. Much to my surprise, he said that I could hold off on the diabetes pills if I lost weight and changed my eating habits.</p>\n<h3><strong>Facing reality </strong></h3>\n<p>When I first joined an Anytime Fitness gym near where I live and started working out with Alex, a personal trainer, I couldn't do a sit-up or a push-up, and 30 seconds was all I could manage on a stationary bike. When I looked at my eating habits, I saw that the first thing I had to do was get honest about how much I was eating. I kept a food log of everything I put into my mouth, and how I felt emotionally and physically at each meal&#151;which helped me keep my emotional eating in check. Within a week, the number on the scale started moving down. Four months later, I went back to the doctor 42 pounds lighter and received incredible news: I was no longer diabetic! Around this time, I was also able to cut way down on my depression meds because my mood had lifted significantly, thanks to the regular exercise.</p>\n<h3><strong>Staying on track </strong></h3>\n<p>Throughout my weight loss, I took photos&#151;starting with day one at the gym&#151;and posted them along with daily progress updates on my Facebook page. This kept me accountable along the way. And it worked! I've lost 132 pounds since I made my original get-healthy commitment. Now, I'm more outgoing and can honestly say that I truly love my body, which is something I never thought would happen.</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Change Takes Time!</em></strong></h3>\n<p>It's easy to get discouraged if you don't keep this in mind. You're not going to immediately love healthy eating. If I had given up at the first bump, I wouldn't be where I am today.</p>\n<h3><strong>My stick-with-it secret?</strong></h3>\n<p>GET A TRAINER WHO GETS YOU. Alex used to be overweight herself, so she knew how to be both challenging and empathetic. She even inspired me to become an athlete again! (I'm now training as a competitive weight lifter.)</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-23T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"948503","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/cf/i-lost-132-pounds-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Cuffey","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6637813","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-23T20:14:27.000Z","author_id":"13163","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's

Gather Materials</strong></h3><br /> \n\nRound up at least 5 feet of Type M &#190;-inch copper tubing, seven eye screws, five No. 6 1-inch machine screws and nuts, nylon twine, and 1 x 6 lumber.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>2.) Map Pipe Mounts</strong></h3><br />\n\nCenter a 4&#189;-inch-diameter circle in a 5&#189;-inch-square cut of lumber. Mark the circle at five equidistant points. Insert eye screws at the circle's center and at all five points.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>3.) Cut Pythagoras</strong></h3><br />  \n\nCut five pieces of tubing to the lengths in the table below and deburr. The chime's five notes, which correspond to a piano's black keys, make up the minor pentatonic scale. The notes are pleasing in any order. The ancient Greeks such as Pythagoras were the first to study the link between the length of a vibrating body and the notes of a musical scale.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/oV/pm-saturday-02-0312-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>4.) Tie With Twine</strong></h3><br />  \n\nDrill a <b>5/32</b>-inch hole through each pipe as listed in the table. These hanging points produce the best chime resonance. Insert a machine screw through the hole and fit a nut onto the screw shank. Tie a 7-inch length of twine from the circle of eye screws to the screw shank in each pipe.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>5.) Hang the Chime</strong></h3><br />  \n\nUse a 2&#189;-inch holesaw to cut a clapper from a 1x scrap. Use more 1x waste to make a V-shaped, 3-inch-long wind scoop. Hang each from the center eye screw. Cut and glue two smaller 1x squares to the top of the first square. Top-center-mount an eye screw in the smallest square.

A handful of people had gathered on the sidewalk, and as they climbed into the coach, Lin stepped down from the driver's seat to help a bearded young man load an oversize green backpack and a pair of wooden stilts into the luggage compartment. For the past four years Lin has worked full-time for a small bus company called Eastern Coach, usually driving a daily New York-to-D.C. round trip. He leaves the curb at 10 am and, if traffic is light, arrives in Washington, D.C., by 3 pm. At 4, he pulls away from the curb again, hoping to deliver his passengers&#151;who pay $20 one way&#151;to Chinatown before 9:30 pm. After that, he returns the bus to a Brooklyn parking lot and takes the subway home to Queens. If he's lucky, he's in the door by midnight.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nLin used to work for a more established company, but he didn't like the rules: \"I had to wear a uniform. I couldn't talk to passengers while driving. I couldn't smoke around the bus,\" he says. His old company usually hired separate drivers for the trips to and from D.C., and the bus was equipped with a speed governor that prevented the driver from breaking the posted limit. \"Everybody speeds a little,\" says Lin, who traveled at a steady 70 mph along a stretch of highway marked at 55 while many passengers dozed in the half-empty bus. What none of them knew was that Eastern has one of the worst safety records of any American bus company, ranking in the top 5 percent in unsafe-driving violations.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>More than 750 million passengers travel</strong></span> by motor coach each year&#151;more than those who take Amtrak and domestic flights combined. The number is up recently, due in part to the weak economy&#151;when money is tight, people take the bus. Nowadays, they have an abundance of options. Dozens of new carriers have joined established companies such as Greyhound and Peter Pan. Many of them, like Eastern, are curbside operators that keep overhead low by forgoing a terminal and picking up and dropping off passengers on a public street.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut there's a hidden cost to a cheap ride, as the nearly 30 fatalities from bus accidents in 2011 illustrate well. March was a particularly bad month, beginning with a grisly crash in the Bronx. A bus returning to New York City's Chinatown from the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut flipped on its side and skidded into a highway signpost, killing 15 people and injuring 18 more. Two days later, an accident on the New Jersey Turnpike killed one passenger and the driver. One week later, a chartered motorcoach rolled over on a New Hampshire highway, resulting in several serious injuries. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn May 31, there was another deadly crash on Interstate 95, just outside Doswell, Va. The motorcoach, operated by a company called Sky Express, was in the right-hand lane just before 5 am, halfway through a 10-hour trip from North Carolina to New York City. As the highway curved gently to the left, the driver&#151;who later admitted to falling asleep at the wheel&#151;didn't alter course. The bus traversed a section of rumble strips before it crossed the shoulder entirely and kept going onto a grass embankment. It careened 381 feet before it rolled onto its roof and finally skidded to a rest another 80 feet from where it had left the highway. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe roof was crushed and the windows shattered. Like most motorcoaches, the 37-year-old bus had no passenger seatbelts. First responders were faced with chaos: From inside the bus came groans of pain and screams for help. Outside, broken glass, duffel bags, and suitcases littered the ground. All 58 passengers had to be transported to area hospitals, dozens with serious injuries. Four passengers died. The only person who didn't require professional medical care was the driver, 37-year-old Kin Yiu Cheung. He was also the only person on the bus whose seat was equipped with a seatbelt.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>For many years, intercity bus</strong></span> travel was extremely safe. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were about six to 10 motorcoach fatalities annually (a figure that includes intercity buses and chartered tour buses but excludes school buses and municipal city buses). Then a disturbing trend emerged. \"We started to see the numbers creep up to around 25 to 30 fatalities a year, which worried us considerably,\" says Norm Littler, executive director of the Bus Industry Safety Council, a group of industry veterans that develops and promotes motorcoach safety procedures. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe increased risk corresponds to the rapid growth of bus carriers in the late 1990s, Littler says. \"There was a lot of capital around. The bus manufacturers started doing what [automakers in] Detroit did: They would build buses when they didn't have sales, put them on the lots, and basically try to collar anybody into buying one.\" At the time, Littler was getting frequent calls from people who wanted to start bus companies. \"I would go through the various regulatory requirements, and it became very obvious very quickly they didn't care about that,\" he says. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThen, on Mother's Day in 1999, a chartered bus destined for a Mississippi casino ran off the road and plowed through a chain-link fence and into an embankment. Twenty-two people were killed and another 22 injured. \"The driver should never have been behind the wheel,\" Littler says. \"He had severe medical problems. He had a long history of drug use. It was a relatively new company that grew very rapidly and simply should not have been in operation.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe crash turned out to be a harbinger. Between 1999 and 2009, 251 people were killed in 67 motorcoach crashes, according to a study by the American Bus Association. More than half the deaths took place on carriers that had already been cited by federal inspectors for unsafe practices; many of those were newcomers to the industry. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>The division of the department</strong></span> of Transportation charged with governing bus safety is known as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). In recent years, the FMCSA has had a hard time keeping up with the expanding and evolving industry. The Mother's Day crash prompted new standards that would require rigorous inspection of any new bus company within its first six months of operation. The federal law included medical requirements for drivers similar to what the Federal Aviation Administration mandates for pilots. Enforcement, though, remains weak. The driver in the March 2011 Bronx crash was working under a false name. Cheung, the driver in the Virginia crash, could not speak English, even though federal law requires it. Bus drivers are supposed to keep a log of their duty hours, and many companies use electronic punch-in systems to prevent the fudging of paper records. Sky Express relied on old-fashioned paper logbooks, and Cheung&#151;who was charged with reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter&#151;hadn't updated his for two days. His behavior was not unusual. And neither was his ability to get away with it before the deadly accident.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs it turned out, the FMCSA had cited Sky Express drivers for fatigue an astounding 48 times in the two years preceding the Virginia crash. The company had violations for unsafe driving, vehicle maintenance, and hours-of-service rules that dictate how long a driver can remain behind the wheel. The upstart carrier&#151;which owned 31 buses and employed 53 drivers&#151;had had four prior highway accidents and the single worst score of any American bus company in the Driver Fitness category. Still, the FMCSA hadn't taken Sky Express off the road. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMichele Beckjord, a survival factors expert at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), says this isn't unusual. \"We've got a lot of unsafe carriers that are getting a 'Satisfactory' rating, but they've got major violations either in maintenance or in driver performance and behavior.\" The problem, she says, is that in order to reach the Unsatisfactory level in the FMCSA's numerical evaluation system, a bus carrier has to have terrible scores in several different areas. \n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/survival/stories/cheap-tickets-fatal-rides-why-bus-crashes-are-on-the-rise-6643777-2\">CONTINUED >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/mF/bus-crashes-01-0412-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-03T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Thompson","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643777","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/outdoors/survival/stories/cheap-tickets-fatal-rides-why-bus-crashes-are-on-the-rise-6643777\">Cheap Tickets, Fatal Rides: Why Bus Crashes Are on the Rise</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/4280752\">Top 10 NASCAR Crashes That Changed Racing (With Videos!)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/news/4277098\">With Church Group Onboard, Did Bad Tire Cause Deadly Texas Bus Crash?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4269354\">Inside the High-Tech Art of Gaming's Realistic Car Crashes </a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/1289266\">Worst-Case Scenarios: How To Survive In A Plummeting Elevator</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/1289281\">Worst-Case Scenarios: How To Survive A Riptide</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4266365\">Another Crane Crashes in New York, but Did Someone See This Coming?

As is the case with many electromechanical parts, however, power antennas usually end up requiring repair. Run through a carwash with one extended and you'll have what looks like a bent hanger sticking out of the fender. Today, power antenna masts have been replaced with fixed antennas or wires embedded in windshields, but there are still plenty of cars out there with these telescoping menaces. Broken antennas get stuck all the way up, all the way down, or often somewhere in between. The shabby appearance of, and stunted radio reception on, an otherwise perfectly good car means that replacing or repairing an antenna is a worthwhile fix.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIt's almost too bad these have gone out of style; they are actually pretty elegant in a Rube Goldberg kind of way. An electric motor hidden below the fender turns nylon gears that eventually mesh with a toothed nylon rope matching the gears. That rope extends all the way through the hollow antenna sections and mounts to the tip. As the motor turns the gears, the rigid rope is pushed or pulled and the mast advances or retracts, stopping based on either a digital counter or timer or on a measured spike in voltage when the motor can't turn anymore. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs you might imagine, there are several ways these antennas malfunction. The most prevalent is a bent mast&#151;even slight tweaks to the tight-fitting telescoping tubes can cause havoc. The nylon bits are a problem, too; teeth from the gears or rope break off from wear or cold or the rope snaps along the length. Sometimes the antenna fails when the components just plain get dirty&#151;rain and dust infiltrate the mechanism, and things grind to a halt. Below we're going to walk through the general steps of removing the whole assembly, taking it apart, then cleaning and replacing the problem parts.\n\n<br /><br />","project_title":"4 Steps to Fix That Pesky Car Radio Antenna"}],"article_type_name":"Step by Step","publish_date":"2012-03-30T20:45:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11205","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Wojdyla","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"step-by-step","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643766","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/home/how-to-plans/10-hilariously-bad-home-diy-projects\">There, I Fixed It: 10 Hilariously Bad Home DIY Projects </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/4324365\">How to Clean, Wax and Detail Your Car : Expert Tips </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/maintenance/how-to-fix-a-car-paint-scratch\">How To Fix a Car Paint Scratch</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/how-to-repair-chipped-car-paint\">How to Repair Car Paint Chips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/1272211\">How To Detail Your Car </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/1272206\">Mechanic Online--Use Your PC To Help Fix Your Car </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/maintenance/4216365\">How to Repair Your Car Scratch</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/repair/4308734\">How to Fix Car Scratches and Dents: PM Resource Guide</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/4301961\">Car Maintenance Quiz: How Do Your Automotive Skills Stack Up?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to-stop-car-battery-drains\">How to Stop Car Battery Drains: DIY Auto</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-29T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1038","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:17:41.000Z","author_id":"10965","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/maintenance/4-steps-to-fix-that-pesky-car-radio-antenna","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Get ready for this enchanting movie with behind the scenes photos of <em>Seventeen</em> cover girl Lily Collins, cast interviews, and exclusive videos!","site_id":"1","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.seventeen.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"behind the scenes, movie scoop, lily collins, mirror mirror, robert emms, armie hammer","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"<i>Mirror Mirror</i> Exclusives!","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-01T20:39:51.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/entertainment/mirrormirror","link_text":"Mirror Mirror Exclusives!"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/video/exclusive-interview-with-mirror-mirror-star-armie-hammer-video-1398218355001","link_text":"Exclusive Interview With Mirror Mirror Star Armie Hammer !

Grab the bar with an overhand grip, duck underneath it and rest the bar across the back of your shoulders. Lift the bar off the rack and step back from it. Slowly squat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Slowly press yourself back up into a standing position, but don't lock your knees.</p>\n\n<h3>Perfect form</h3>\n<p><strong>Your head</strong> Keep your head facing forwards at all times. Moving your head can cause you to lose your balance, and places stress on your neck and trapezius muscles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your shoulders</strong> The bar should rest comfortably across your shoulders, directly behind your neck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your knees</strong> At the top of the move, straighten your legs but don't lock your knees. Locking your knees takes the load off your muscles and puts it onto your knee joints. At the bottom, keep your knees directly over your toes, but don't let them go past your feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your eyes</strong> Focus straight ahead and avoid looking down to watch yourself perform the exercise. Looking down or turning your head to either side while you squat makes it more difficult to stay balanced. Stand in front of a mirror instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your hands</strong> Space them slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip (palms facing forward). The weight of the bar should rest across your shoulders, so the only reason you're using your hands is to prevent the bar from sliding backward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your wrists</strong> Don't let your wrists bend backward or forward. Keeping them straight in line with your forearms makes it easier to hold the bar in place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your back</strong> Maintain a straight back throughout the lift. Arching your back prevents the weight of the bar from being distributed evenly down to your legs, and also places unnecessary stress on your lower back and spinal column.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your elbows</strong> Your elbows should point straight down, so your forearms are perpendicular to the floor. Pulling the elbows back or shifting them forward places your arms in an unnatural position that can compromise the move.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your feet</strong> Space your feet shoulder-width apart with your toes pointing straight ahead. keep pressed flat on the floor at all times. Lifting up on your toes can disrupt your  balance and make the lift dangerous to perform.</p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite (UK)","publish_date":"2012-03-30T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21141","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Health","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641637","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/blogs/perfect-form-the-squat\">Perfect your form : the squat </a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/get-more-from-bent-over-rows\">Get more from&hellip;. the bent over row</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/the-burning-questions-202084\">The burning questions</a><br>\n<a href=\"/building-muscle/the-worlds-most-efficient-workout\">The world's most efficient workout</a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/get-more-from-overhead-press\">Get more from&hellip;

Despite the National Transportation Safety Board's recent call for a nationwide ban on &#173;in-car cell&#173;phone use, car buyers are increasingly demanding  smartphone-style connectivity. And carmakers are scrambling to provide interactive systems that harness or imitate the features of popular handsets. These so-called infotainment systems, such as Ford's Sync and Toyota's Entune, have voice control and Internet connectivity, and they can run apps such as Pandora. In a world where quality engineering can be bought even in entry-level cars, infotainment systems are increasingly seen as a differentiator&#151;but they have become a high-tech headache for automakers.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"It's kind of a mess,\" says Roger Lanctot, a senior analyst at technology research firm Strategy Analytics. \"Because all of these systems are proprietary, it's expensive to deploy content app by app. They are also all brand-new, and they all work differently, so you have usability issues and glitches galore.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY TRAP</strong></h3><br />\n\nArguably one of the most advanced infotainment systems on the market is Sync with MyFord Touch, available as an option on all of Ford's consumer models. Its capabilities are formidable: It has touch-sensitive, capacitive buttons; it can understand complex voice commands, make hands-free calls, read your text messages to you, run Pandora from connected smartphone devices, and give you turn-by-turn navigation. But for all of its sophistication, MyFord Touch has been criticized for being slow, cluttered, and confusing. The system is a big reason why Ford fell from fifth place to 23rd in J.D. Power's 2011 Initial Quality Study. Now Ford is sending out more than 300,000 USB drives to update it. Systems like MyFord Touch tap into the cellular-connection and data-processing power of smartphones for many of their functions, but deliver user interfaces that pale in comparison to those of the phones. All of which raises the question: Why don't automakers just use the phone operating systems in the first place? \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>PHONING IT IN</strong></h3><br />\n\nAs it turns out, there are systems in development that can, to a degree, port your smartphone's UI to your vehicle's screen. One such technology is Nokia's MirrorLink. Once the phone is &#173;connected to the car, MirrorLink essentially turns your dashboard display into a slightly modified version of your smartphone screen&#151;as long as the phone and the vehicle display are &#173;MirrorLink-capable. MirrorLink has some big backers, including Toyota, General Motors, Nokia, and LG and could start appearing in select vehicles and phones in the U.S. in the next couple of years, Lanctot says. But then again, it may not, since one company notably absent from the MirrorLink supporter list is Apple, the most influential smartphone-maker in the world.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut even if smartphones are superior to most factory-&#173;installed infotainment systems, that doesn't necessarily mean they are an ideal replacement. Andrew Poliak is director of automotive business development at QNX, a software company that has provided the code for almost 30 million vehicles on the road. \"You have an expectation of how an application behaves on your phone, with a small display and a ton of RAM,\" he says. \"You're used to scrolling around through menus and pinching and zooming and all these things, and when you take that same display and replicate it in the car, the experience isn't the same.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSystems such as MirrorLink also could exacerbate the nettlesome problem of &#173;driver distraction. When a carmaker creates its own interface, it can control the driving experience. But if the screen in the vehicle is essentially a pass-through to somebody else's software, that raises a big red liability flag. So automakers will want to tightly control which apps and functions are allowed. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nStill, using the phone's interface could free carmakers from some of the fast-paced burdens of software development. Vehicles generally take years to design, while smartphone operating systems and apps can be updated every few months. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>CUE THE FUTURE</strong></h3><br />\n\nIf MirrorLink is the answer, it's only a temporary one. According to Mike Hichme, engineering manager for Cadillac's Cue system, no car can be fully dependent on a phone. \"[MirrorLink] is a feature; that's not the solution,\" he says. Automakers still need to design radio, HVAC, and other basic vehicle controls. No car company is willing to just hand off fundamental parts of the driving experience to a phone.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nPlus, it turns out that auto interfaces  may be learning some smartphone tricks after all. Hichme's Cue system, set to premiere in three models later this year, can run HTML5, the same software language behind powerful Web apps such as Gmail. HTML5 should make it easier for developers to create apps that run across all platforms&#151;which may ultimately&#173; neutralize the power struggle between smartphone and car. Still, HTML5 doesn't mean an app free-for-all. No one thinks playing Angry Birds in the car is wise. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nUnfortunately for automakers, none of this makes the decisions any easier. If a car is just beginning the production process, there's no one answer and no knowing where the industry will be three or four years from now. \"It's just painful to have to make these decisions when things are changing too damn fast,\" &#173;Lanctot says.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-27T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Del-Colle","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643773","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/cars/best-infotainment-apps-reviews\">The Coming Explosion of In-Car Infotainment Apps </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/why-your-smartphone-will-become-your-in-car-infotainment-system\">Why Your Smartphone Will Become Your In-Car Infotainment System</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/products/build-your-own-car-infotainment-system\">Build Your Own Car Infotainment System</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/health/med-tech/smartphone-shrink-5-apps-to-help-your-mental-health\">Smartphone Shrink: 5 Apps To Help Your Mental Health</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/how-to/products/10-handy-smartphone-apps-for-drivers\">10 Handy Smartphone Apps for Drivers</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/4220784\">Smartphone Lab Test: iPhone vs. 7 Top Wireless Wonders</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4285566\">Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a WannaBe iPhone With Awesome Speaker: Hands-On First Look</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/iPhone-4s-pms-tech-editors-debate-apples-newest-smartphone-6504842\">iPhone 4s: PM's Tech Editors Debate Apple's Newest Smartphone </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/news/industry/the-mobile-mess-why-isnt-car-connectivity-better-6643773\">The Mobile Mess: Why Isn't Car Connectivity Better?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/why-do-apps-crash\">Why Do Apps Crash?</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-29T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:17:45.000Z","author_id":"11495","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/industry/the-mobile-mess-why-isnt-car-connectivity-better-6643773","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Stanley's FatMax has been the reigning champ of job-site tape measures.

These run the gamut from fishy to believable, but have one thing in common: a near-total lack of substantiation. I decided to sacrifice a disused iPhone 3G for testing, a process that started with a pair of keys and ended, painfully, with a screwdriver. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOne standout claim is that a coat of Turtle Wax will minimize scratches; in my testing, it did nothing of the sort, and left behind a thin film of wax, which attracted fingerprints. Others point to 3M scratch remover for cars as a possibility; three rigorous applications did nothing for the iPhone. Displex, a polish for plastic screens and another favorite among online DIYers, left the screen immaculately shiny and seemed to darken the appearance of scratches, but this was a temporary effect of lingering residue. I even scrubbed the screen with toothpaste until my arm was sore, which had no lasting effect. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere is, of course, an extreme option: glass buffing. With a small drill attachment and a tub of cerium oxide compound (and for deep scratches, some sandpaper), it is possible to grind scratches out of a screen, the same way you would buff scratches out of auto glass. My testing indicates that this is a very bad idea. Glass grinding requires the steady application of wet-mixed cerium oxide, which is quite messy, and sprayed water, a natural enemy of all things electronic. I attempted to seal the phone with tape, but the sticky cerium slop found its way into almost every opening, drying like a fine cement.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs for the scratches, I was just starting to see improvement when I noticed a new type of blemish. My inconsistent water application had resulted in overheating, which destroyed an area of the underlying LCD. For a touchscreen device, glass grinding is, in other words, overkill, with an emphasis on \"kill.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe best solution, short of screen replacement, is a screen-protector film. It won't just shield from future scratches&#151;it will make some shallow ones invisible.\n<br /><br />\n\n</div>\n\n</div>","article_type_name":"Open Format Article","publish_date":"2012-03-26T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11119","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Herrman","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643768","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/diy-tablet-computer-company-compete-apple-ipad\">How to Start a Tablet Company (and Compete With Apple's iPad )</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/gadgets/4339778\">How to Convert a Netbook Into a Touchscreen PC </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/archos-10-inch-g9-tablet-lightning-review\">ARCHOS 10-Inch G9 Tablet : Lightning Review</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4341444\">Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3t Is a Convertable Touchscreen Tablet </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/iPhone-4s-pms-tech-editors-debate-apples-newest-smartphone-6504842\">iPhone 4s: PM's Tech Editors Debate Apple's Newest Smartphone </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/new-tablet-side-by-side-comparison\">We Compare the New Tablets Side-By-Side</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4218636\">Apple iPhone : Out of the Box Review (with Video)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/tablet-review-round-up\">Tablet Watch: All the Tablet Computers, in One Place</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4343867\">Topping the Tablet : Apple iPad Hands-On Review</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/how-to-fix-a-scratched-touchscreen-6643768\">How to Fix a Scratched Touchscreen </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-29T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"10","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:17:42.000Z","author_id":"10855","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/how-to/tips/how-to-fix-a-scratched-touchscreen-6643768","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Avoid uttering these harsh words, no matter how innocent they seem","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"friendship tips, improve friendship, friend tips","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"9 Things You Should Never Say to Your Best Friend","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-26T20:02:46.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/how-to-mend-a-friendship-99526","link_text":"How to Mend a Friendship"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/the-link-between-obesity-friendship-114902","link_text":"The Link Between Obesity and Friendship"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/health-fitness/10-better-for-you-new-years-resolutions-114467","link_text":"10 Better-for-You New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/how-to-handle-tricky-friend-situations-114176","link_text":"How to Handle Tricky Friend Situations"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/letting-go-of-a-friendship-119330","link_text":"Letting Go of a Friendship"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/more-from-sex-and-relationships","link_text":"Sex + Relationships More From Links"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/tips-for-a-successful-marriage-17170","link_text":"Tips for a Successful Marriage"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/sex-relationships/7-tips-to-get-your-hubby-talking-108531","link_text":"7 Tips to Get Your Hubby Talking"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/wd-readers-best-organizing-tips-101978","link_text":"WD Readers&rsquo;

Well, yes and no. Your close relationship gives you lots of leeway, but there&#146;s a fine line between honest and insulting. While you may think you&#146;ve never said anything offensive to your BFF, there have likely been times that your words have inadvertently stung. Saying something as simple as, &#147;Hey, have you lost weight?&#148; could elicit a&#160; different reaction than you expected, thanks to its loaded meaning, says Jill Melton, communication expert and author of <a href=\"http://www.thepowerofthezip.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Power of the Zip</em></a><em>. </em>&#160;Read on for nine things you should never say to your best friend, plus learn better ways to get your point across.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Don't you want children?&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, there are obviously offensive comments you wouldn&#146;t make to childless friends, like what a pal once told Helen*: &#147;Good thing you never had kids&#151;you can hardly take care of yourself!&#148; But even the mild-sounding &#147;Don&#146;t you want children?&#148; makes assumptions about what&#146;s going on in another person&#146;s head and life, says Melton. What if your friend desperately<em> </em>wants kids but is struggling with infertility? Or what if she doesn&#146;t want to be a mother but would rather avoid an awkward conversation about her decision? When it comes to discussing kids, let your friend take the lead. &#147;If she wants to discuss her choice, she&#146;ll bring it up herself,&#148; says Melton. <br /> &#160;<br /> &#147;<strong>You've lost weight!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#160;&#147;Weight is a dirty word&#151;period,&#148; says Lillian Glass, PhD, body language expert and author of <a href=\"http://www.drlillianglass.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Body Language Advantage</em></a>. Even if you&#146;re trying to give a compliment, this statement can confuse, or even insult, your friend. What if she lost weight because she&#146;s been depressed? Or perhaps she didn&#146;t think she&#146;d lost any weight and now worries that you thought she was overweight before. If you suspect that your friend has slimmed down, just say, &#147;You look wonderful!&#148; advises Dr. Glass. Who knows&#150;&#150;she could look great thanks to a fabulous haircut or new outfit; there&#146;s no need to make assumptions about what changed. That said, if a friend has dropped an alarming amount of weight and you&#146;re worried about her health, bring it up in a way that conveys your concern, says Melton. Try, &#147;I&#146;ve noticed you&#146;re looking thinner lately. Is something going on that you want to talk about?&#148;</p>\n<p>&#147;<strong>That guy you&#146;re dating? Not marriage material!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Lisa*&#146;s friend asked her opinion about a new beau, and she gave him the thumbs-down&#151;with friendship-fizzling results. &#147;My pal ended up marrying the guy, and now she&#146;s distant,&#148; says Lisa. &#147;I thought I was being a good friend by pointing out the facts, but I should have listened to my dad&#146;s reminder, &#145;Everyone chooses their own sweetheart,&#146; and kept my mouth shut.&#148; If your friend&#146;s guy seems like a bad choice <em>to you</em>&#150;&#150;but she hasn&#146;t asked your opinion&#150;&#150;keep your judgments to yourself. Aside from having hard evidence about serious stuff (like he has a wife and kids in another city, or is a drug dealer, for example), you really don&#146;t<em> </em>know if he&#146;s &#147;wrong&#148; for her. If she does ask what you think, &#147;turn it back to her,&#148; suggests Melton. Try: &#147;I don&#146;t know him as well as you do. Tell me what you like and don&#146;t like about him.&#148; Then you can base what you say on her response, so your thoughts don&#146;t seem out of the blue.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;You bought <em>what?!</em>&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>If your best friend constantly complains about tough financial times and then shows up with a trendy designer bag, it can be tempting to call her out on her spending. But a judgment-riddled &#147;are you <em>kidding </em>me?! What did that cost?&#148; is decidedly the wrong thing to say because &#147;you&#146;re not in charge of her budget. She is,&#148; says Melton. Consider, too, that you may not know where her money&#146;s coming from, says Dr. Glass: &#147;What if she&#146;s spending a gift from someone else?&#148; So if you notice something brand-spanking new and expensive, just say, &#147;Wow, cool boots,&#148; or &#147;What a great new car.&#148; That said, if she asks<em> </em>you for help managing her money (or to borrow some of yours), gently point out ways she can trim her costs or try these other ideas for <a href=\"http://www.womansday.com/life/saving-money/balancing-friends-family-finances-119034?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">balancing friends and finances</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Congrats on a well-deserved promotion! You&#146;ve been in that position for <em>so long</em>.&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>What&#146;s the problem with a congratulatory remark? A lot if it&#146;s actually a backhanded compliment. The above implies that your friend didn&#146;t quite earn the promotion. Instead of suggesting that anyone in her (worn) shoes would have gotten a bump at work, try a hearty, &#147;Good for you! Very impressive!&#148; suggests Melton. And if your friend suspects that she, say, got that promotion because she&#146;d been in that job so long it would&#146;ve been embarrassing not to, leave the door open for her to discuss that with you. You should be a sounding board for your friend, not a sniper.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;How dare you not tell me [you bought a new car/got a new job/met a new guy]!&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>On the one hand, says Dr. Glass, &#147;It&#146;s reasonable to feel slighted if your good friend doesn&#146;t share news with you.&#148; It&#146;s expressing your anger over being left out that&#146;s a no-no. &#147;Some friends don&#146;t keep you posted on everything for reasons that have nothing to do with you,&#148; says Melton. Saying something like this makes the situation all about you feeling excluded<em>, </em>not about what&#146;s happening in your friend&#146;s life. When you do hear your pal&#146;s good news, just tell her, &#147;I&#146;m so happy for you.&#148; If this happens often and you worry that your friend is keeping updates from you, open up a discussion about it. Could it be you haven&#146;t been that enthusiastic about her news in the past, or have shared her info with others without her permission? See what you could do differently before scolding her for not filling you in.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;I wish <em>my </em>husband were as great as yours!&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>Why wouldn&#146;t it be wonderful to hear you&#146;ve scored big in the life-partner department? Because the friend who says this is subtly (or not so subtly) downgrading her own spouse, which can be awkward for the person on the other side of the conversation. &#147;A friend said that to me about my husband when she was going through a divorce,&#148; says Shelly.* Feeling uncomfortable and unwilling to bash her friend&#146;s spouse, Shelly&#146;s taken to responding with, &#147;Yep, he&#146;s a good guy,&#148; and changing the subject. While occasional compliments are completely fine, avoid making comparisons: &#147;They reveal jealousy,&#148; says Dr. Glass. If you&#146;re having problems with your partner you can certainly ask your happily married buddy for advice, adds Melton. &#147;But since every relationship is unique, a comparison isn&#146;t a good way to start that conversation.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Your wedding was so tiny!&#148; or &#147;You&#146;re so much bigger than I was when I was pregnant!&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>What may seem like a harmless observation to you can actually come across as a cruel comparison. Anna&#146;s* friend once said, &#147;It was good you got married first; now I know what I don&#146;t want at my wedding!&#148; Anna was floored. Before you say something like that, examine your motives for wanting to do so, suggests Melton. Anna&#146;s friend, for example, may have wanted planning advice, and she could have told Anna what she <em>loved </em>about her wedding instead of cutting down her friend&#146;s choices. &#147;Try to figure out what exactly your friend&#146;s wedding [or pregnancy] triggered in you,&#148; says Melton.&#160;Are you having second thoughts about some of your wedding choices? Worrying about how much weight you&#146;ve gained by your second trimester? Once you uncover what&#146;s at the root of your observations, you can express your feelings without sounding snarky.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Don&#146;t worry. It&#146;ll be fine.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Shelly still feels the sting of friends&#146; trite platitudes when her mother was terminally ill, because of course things <em>weren&#146;t </em>fine. In situations like this, your friend might be worried for good reason, so saying &#147;don&#146;t worry&#148; is dismissive, explains Melton. Instead, use your judgment based on the situation. In some cases saying &#147;it&#146;ll be fine&#148; in a loving, sincere way can show your compassion, says Dr. Glass. But much of the time, it&#146;s better to use words that show your friend that you feel her pain, that you&#146;re pulling for her and that you may not know what it&#146;s like to, say, lose your&#160; mother, but you&#146;re<em> </em>in her corner as she goes through the worst of it. A simple, &#147;I&#146;m here if you need me&#148; goes a long way, especially if you follow that up with concrete ways to help her through her rough time, whether that&#146;s picking up her kids from soccer, bringing over dinner or just sharing some wine and company.</p>\n<p><em>*These names have been

The result? The most challenging workout of your life, <br />delivering explosive gains in just 20 minutes</h3>\n\n<h2>Core fission</h2>\n<h4>The Dual-Cable Crunch hits your core three times harder than a regular crunch, giving you full ab activation</h4>\n\n<p><br /><a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/video/?click=vid_sr&click=vid_sr#v1452258195\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MH video: weighted crunch\">Normal crunches</a> involve a &#145;flexion&#146; movement (chest to hips) which only works some of your abs. &#147;The Dual-Cable Crunch also incorporates an &#145;extension&#146; movement (bending backwards),&#148; says conditioning expert Phil Learney, &#147;and the addition of a dip belt pulls you forwards, activating your supporting muscles for stabilisation.&#148; Combining extension and flexion moves with this instability allows you to work all of your abdominal muscles, giving your core three times the ab-firing benefit.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/dual-cable-crunch.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> Fix a rope attachment to an overhead position on one side of a cable rack. Start with a 10kg load. Walk to the other side, attach the chain of a dip belt at hip-height and wrap it around your glutes. Walk backwards and grab the rope attachment behind your head with a firm grip. Find the optimum position at which the dip belt&#146;s chain is fully extended, so there is resistance when you move your hips back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2</strong> Keeping your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your weight evenly distributed, push your hips forward and extend your body backwards. Still gripping the rope attachment by your head, pull the cable forward in a crunch motion. Keep the movement slow and controlled (2 seconds down, 1 second pause, 2 seconds up) to stay balanced as the dip belt chain tries to pull you forward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong> The standing crunch means that your glutes, hamstrings\nand quads are locked out, so your core and abs &#150; the fulcrum between upper and lower body movements &#150; are hit even harder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perfect form</strong> \"Crunch by moving your hips, not your knees,&#148; says Learney. &#147;Using your hips will maximise your extension and flexion to really hit your abs.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>First time</strong> 3 x 5 reps \n<br /><strong>Your aim</strong> 3 x 12 reps</p>\n\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<h4>Instability means Chain Box Squats fire almost 100% of your lower body muscles, trouncing regular squats</h4>\n\n<p><br />First things first: squatting onto a box forces you to descend deeper than usual, placing additional stress on the hamstrings and glutes, and developing a superior range of movement. But there&#146;s more. &#147;A box squat enhances the myotatic reflex,&#148; says Learney &#150; the reflex that causes a stretched muscle to rapidly contract. Firing up your glutes from a static squat position enhances this reflex for a powerful contraction, developing explosive force which will power up your sprint speed and jump height. &#147;The chains force your core and stabilising muscles into action, too&#148; adds Learney. And recruiting your hamstrings and glutes means you are using your entire lower posterior chain, so you&#146;ll be able to lift more weight and build more muscle with each rep.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/chain-box-squats.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> Stand under a squat rack with a box (just lower than knee height) behind you. Drape chains around each side of the barbell. If your gym doesn&#146;t have chains, use resistance bands and connect them to the rack. Rest the barbell on your upper back, holding it just outside shoulder-width. Lift the bar and\nstep forward. With your knees slightly bent and your back in a natural arch, slowly lower by moving your hips back.\n<p><strong>2</strong> Sit on the box and pause for 2 seconds. Now explosively force your body upwards, driving with your glutes. Keep eyes focused straight ahead throughout.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong> Starting the drive phase of a squat from a completely static sitting position puts extreme emphasis on your glutes &#150; the muscle group most likely to limit your strength.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perfect form</strong> The oscillation from the chains will make it hard to balance. Lock your abs tight to increase the stabilising power of your core.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First time</strong> 3 x 5 reps \n<br /><strong>Your aim</strong> 3 x 12 reps</p>\n\n<h2>Dynamic physics</h2>\n<h4>The mid-air Muscle-Up is 15 times tougher than the more stable pull-up, for 15 times the muscular growth</h4>\n\n<p><br />Maximum muscular exertion in minimum time is this move&#146;s USP. &#147;Combining the highest possible pull-up with the deepest possible dip creates a fluid movement that taxes your entire upper body, from your wrists to your back,&#148; explains <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/blogs/different-class/crossfit-exercise-class-blog\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"We test run CrossFit training\">CrossFit</a> instructor Rachel Steadman. The rings create a dynamic environment, recruiting more arm, chest and core muscle fibres to combat gravity and instability. This is hugely taxing, so you should be able to complete 10-15 pull-ups and 10-15 dips separately before you attempt a Muscle-Up. The reward is a defined, muscular V-shaped torso. And the chance to show off to less able gym mates.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/muscle-up-2801.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> Grab two suspended rings with a &#145;false grip&#146; by rolling the meatier part of your palm over the ring. This shortens your forearm to boost strength. Pull up to your chest, elbows tucked in, with the rings parallel.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> Once your chest has reached the rings, turn them 90 degrees, and push the rings out under your armpits as you drive up into a dip position. Lean your shoulders over the rings and move your elbows behind you.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> Balance by returning the rings to a parallel position close to your body and contracting your abs. Perform a dip to complete the Muscle-Up, by pushing up until your arms are straight. Keep your legs slightly forward of the rings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong> In addition to all the usual pull-up muscles, the dip section of the Muscle-Up works your forearms, triceps, biceps, abs and pecs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perfect form</strong> &#147;The Muscle-Up gets harder the further the rings move away from you, so keep them tight to your body,&#148; says Steadman.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First time</strong> 3 x 3 reps \n<br /><strong>Your aim</strong> 3 x 12 reps</p>\n\n<h2>Atomic power</h2>\n<h4>The TRX Total-Body Move demands 30% more power from every muscle group than a kettlebell get-up</h4>\n\n<p><br />This move, created by personal trainer Ben Camara, simulates the same &#145;prone to standing&#146; transition as a <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/video/?click=vid_sr&click=vid_sr#v1454954581\" title=\"MH video: Turkish get-up\" target=\"_blank\">Turkish get-up</a>, but with some vicious bolt-ons. &#147;The suspension works your stabilisers and abs, while having just one leg in the TRX rings forces you to control the weight of your other leg, so it&#146;s even more punishing,&#148; says Camara. This move will also improve your joint mobility and coordination.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/trx-total-body-move.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> Lie in a press-up position, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Place one foot in the TRX suspension rings and raise your free leg alongside it. Perform a &#145;scorpion press-up&#146;: a normal press-up, but with your free leg bent above your other leg like a scorpion&#146;s tail.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> Return your free leg back alongside your suspended leg and thrust both legs forward, recruiting power from your hips. Bend your knees, landing your free leg on the floor between your arms in a lunge position, much like a sprinter in the blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> Raise your body up, balancing on your free leg, then explosively jump onto a step in front of you. Land on your free foot, then drive the knee of your suspended leg upwards. Return to start position and repeat. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong>  The powerful jumping phase develops explosive muscle and chisels out your obliques as you fight to maintain balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perfect form</strong>  &#147;To avoid injury and ensure your muscles work in sync, keep your back straight throughout the move,&#148; advises Camara. &#147;Never let your posture slip as a result of fatigue.&#148;</p>\n\n<p><strong>First time</strong> 3 x 30 seconds (with each leg) \n<br /><strong>Your aim</strong> 5 x 1 minute (with each leg)</p>\n\n<h2>Your 20-minute circuit for explosive results</h2>\n<p>Once you&#146;ve mastered these moves, incorporate them into the ultimate challenge for your muscles: a full-body, circuit-based workout you can do in your lunchbreak (and still find time to eat).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Order</strong> Chain Box Squats &#8658; Muscle-Ups &#8658; Dual-Cable Crunch &#8658; TRX Total Body Move \n<br /><strong>Form</strong>

By saving money from his after-school job blacking stoves, Richards cobbled together enough parts to assemble a runabout that rolled on four skinny tires and was powered by a single-cylinder engine. \"I had no knowledge of the principles and practice of gasoline engine construction,\" Richards said, \"yet I not only managed to make it but to build the transmission mechanism, friction clutch, spark-timing mechanism, body running gear, etc., even doing the necessary blacksmithing... I stuck to the job and am gratified with the result.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIf Mark Richards were alive today, he would love the story of Bob Dullam, a sculptor in Kalamazoo, Mich., who received one of our 2009 Backyard Genius Awards for building a replica of the Tumbler Batmobile. Dullam fabricated a steel chassis and laid on body plates made of epoxy reinforced with fiberglass matte, then dropped in a 350 Chevy V-8 and slapped on 44-inch-wide Super Swamper tires. Why did Dullam spend $50,000 on his beast? \"I like Batman,\" he says, \"and the only way to get this car was to build it myself.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe impulse to tinker, to putter, to do it yourself instead of buying it or paying someone to do it for you&#151;Richards and Dullam share that mindset with millions of do-it-yourselfers. Sometimes economic necessity drives this impulse, and other times the motivation has no price tag&#151;it's the pride and freedom that come with self-reliance.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn 2012, as <em>Popular Mechanics</em> celebrates 110 years in publication, self-reliance remains a guiding principle of the magazine. While PM's long-standing slogan \"Written So You Can Understand It\" no longer appears on the cover, the magazine's mission remains the same: Use plain language to present stories about how things work&#151;whether those things are internal combustion engines, supercomputers, or spacecraft&#151;as well as how to make and fix things yourself. Indeed, <em>Popular Mechanics</em> has depicted and fostered DIY for more than a century, which is why we chose it as the subject of this month's cover story.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBy the time PM debuted in 1902, the Second Industrial Revolution was at full gallop and DIY was embedded in the American grain. Railroads had punched all the way to the West Coast, factories were gobbling up farmland, and the country was changing from a rural nation into an urban one. The year after Mark Richards built his runabout, Henry Ford and David Dunbar Buick, a couple of hardcore DIYers, jumped into the burgeoning automobile business. In the decades straddling the 19th and 20th centuries, while the first great car craze swept the nation, another significant trend emerged: Between 1890 and 1930, home ownership tripled and the American house itself became a project.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nTo guide the masses, the early issues of <em>Popular Mechanics</em> were aimed at the initiated. Many readers were part of the rising class of mechanical professionals, people who knew how to fashion a miter joint, operate a lathe, and handle a drill press. The magazine's Shop Notes offered advice on \"How to Temper Springs\" and \"Punching Structural Steel for Locomotive Tenders,\" while Amateur Mechanics taught younger readers how to make such things as a dovetail-joint puzzle. On a parallel track, by 1930 Sears, Roebuck & Co. had a building-materials catalog offering \"everything you need to build, remodel, modernize or repair your house.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs America emerged from the Great Depression, the first golden age of PM's DIY coverage dawned with the introduction of the Solving Home Problems and The Craftsman sections. The former offered little tips (put a sponge-rubber ball on the end of a coat hook to keep hats from slipping off), while the latter showed how to tackle big jobs (\"Outdoor Fireplace of Poured Concrete\").\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAfter a lull during World War II, DIY exploded along with the postwar economic boom. Suburban housing developments, typified by Levittowns near Philadelphia and on Long Island, provided a vast opportunity for DIYers. As soon as people moved into a cookie-cutter Levittown house, they started making modifications&#151;adding a porch, expanding the garage, building a dormer. Technology was there to lend a hand with the introduction of lightweight portable power tools and the popularization of such convenient materials as drywall, Formica, and latex paint. And while Detroit kept cranking out ever more exotic cars, gearheads from the East Coast to California were out in the garage using yesteryear's models to concoct their very own one-of-a-kind kandy-kolored tangerine-flake streamline babies. PM responded in 1962 by introducing one of our longest-running and most avidly read sections of the magazine, Saturday Mechanic.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBeginning in 1971, Appliance Clinic helped readers deal with a deluge of electronic devices and household appliances; a decade later, computers were added to the mix with the advent of Software Monitor. A California kid named Steve Jobs, who grew up building Heathkit electronics projects, would later say that his boyhood forays into DIY \"gave a tremendous level of self-confidence, that through exploration and learning one could understand seemingly very complex things.\" After dropping out of college, Jobs retreated to his parents' garage with a buddy named Steve Wozniak to modify the first personal computer, the Altair 8800. You know the rest of that story.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nJobs would later say that one of the \"bibles\" of his generation was <i>The Whole Earth Catalog,</i> a DIY project begun in 1968 by Stewart Brand, who put issues together with a couple of friends in Menlo Park, Calif., using an IBM Selectric typewriter and a Polaroid MP-3 camera. While the catalog appealed primarily to the counterculture, and PM stuck to the mainstream, both publications celebrated self-reliance. \"It was all about empowering individuals,\" Brand says. \"The people who read it were interested in starting over from scratch.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAlthough the DIY mindset seemed to fade in the 1980s and '90s with the rise of the digital era, it returned in a new form at the start of the 21st century. While computer modding has roots in the late 1970s, its analog cousin&#151;the maker movement&#151;sprang to life in the early 2000s. Happily for PM, we are now in the midst of a hands-on creative resurgence. \"What's going on today is fantastic,\" Brand says. \"Maker Faire, DIYbio in Boston, tech schemers and dreamers, garage biotech people writing genetic code&#151;basically what you've got now is a tech-friendly generation of young people who are aware they can mess with the hardware as much as the software.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOne of the hottest of the many DIY hotbeds is Brooklyn, N.Y. In the Boerum Hill neighborhood, half a dozen young co-workers gathered recently in the offices of MakerBot Industries, which has shipped more than 6500 of its desktop 3D printers to customers all over the world. Bre Pettis, the company's 39-year-old co-founder and CEO, was regaling the group with tales of childhood adventures with an uncle in Boston who used to get up at 4 am to cruise the city's garbage-truck routes, scavenging stuff he would fix and reuse or sell at weekend flea markets. \"Together we built a bicycle for me from spare parts,\" Pettis said. \"It was a dirt bike, and we painted it black. At the end I had this aha! moment&#151;this bike is mine, and I can fix it if it breaks. Mystery was replaced by pure satisfaction. It's very powerful when you're 6 years old and realize you can fix anything.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThanks to DIY's open-source ethos, he added, people today can make almost anything using off-the-shelf modules and parts, backed by a community willing to share designs, ideas, and computer code. \"We started this company because we wanted to have a machine that can make anything,\" Pettis said, \"putting the power of manufacturing in people's hands.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMakerBot's 3D printer, for all its wizardry, is not really something new. Rather, like <em>Popular Mechanics</em> today, the invention is a contemporary manifestation of a very old tradition. It's the latest link in an unbroken DIY chain that goes as far back as Ben Franklin's stove, Mark Richards's runabout, Henry Ford's Model T, Stewart Brand's catalog, and Bob Dullam's Batmobile. It's a safe bet that someone is out in the garage or down in the basement right now, working on the next big thing. Tinkering, puttering, hacking. Doing it himself.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/skills/tips-tools-and-tinkering-110-years-of-popular-mechanics-diy-2\">The Ages of DIY Timeline >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/gb/110-years-of-diy-02-0312-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-19T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Morris","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"adiegel","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643780","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/home/improvement/9-things-to-fix-around-the-house-before-they-get-worse\">9 Things to Fix Around the House Before They Get Worse</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/reviews/quick-easy-home-fixes\">Quick Home Fixes &amp;

The 11-year-old decided right then to create his own. Twenty-six years later, Dodworth's company, Lightwave International, is one of the biggest laser-entertainment providers in the world. He has fashioned special effects for Hollywood movies, designed light shows for Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Madonna, and projected Nike's logo onto a mountain for the Fiesta Bowl. As an electrical engineer, Dodworth is involved in every aspect of his craft, from building the equipment to devising new ways to control the beams. The hours can be grueling, but the lifestyle glamorous. \"You meet the biggest stars, directors, and lighting designers,\" he says. \"But we just go in humble and do our jobs.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/FI/laserist-my-job-0312-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">1. Lasers</h3><br />\n\nInside a laser projector, a variety of lenses, beam splitters, and electronics controls the beam of light. By mixing high-efficiency solid-state diode lasers in six colors&#151;blue, cyan, gold, green, red, and violet&#151;Dodworth can create 2.8 trillion&#173; color variations. Electrical signals control tiny mirrors inside the projector that move at 60,000 times per second, allowing Dodworth to \"draw\" animations.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">2. Goggles</h3><br />\n\nA rogue beam can harm eyes, so Dodworth dons goggles coated with metal oxides that reflect the bandwidth of light used by lasers. At shows, beams are typically required to be 10 feet above the audience. But by using equipment that keeps power low, moves beams quickly, and limits pulses in a given time period, Dodworth can safely direct effects into a crowd. \"Don't try this at home,\" he says.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">3. Computer</h3><br />\n\nDodworth uses special laser software to create his effects. Customized hardware on the computer converts his digital code into analog signals that manage the color of each beam and its movement.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">4. Mirrors</h3><br />\n\nOn show day, Dodworth installs and aligns lasers, as well as 4- to 12-inch silver-coated mirrors that direct beams. He rotates each mirror into position with fine-pitch screws&#151;100 turns per inch&#151;as he guides the source beam remotely with an iPad app.","article_type_name":"Open Format

It's even more satisfying if you sit with somebody, and if the seat is something you've built, well, so much the better. We'd like to help by suggesting your next project&#151;this garden bench. Start with seven pieces of lumber and a handful of hardware. Spend a couple of free afternoons cutting and boring. When you're done, you'll have fine seating for one or two&#151;in fact, three kids could even rest comfortably on it. It's built to last, with a slatted top made from 2 &#215; 4 lumber turned on edge, bolted to stout 4 &#215; 4 legs. We recommend using Western red cedar, which is naturally rot resistant. Build a bench now, and you'll be ready for that first warm day this year and for years to come.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<div style=\"float:right; margin-left:5px; border: 1px solid #cccccc; padding: 2px; width: 200px; background-color: #CCCCCC\"> <h3 style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #cc0000\">PRINTABLE PLANS</h3>\n<div style=\"float:left; margin-right:2px;\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/1G/pdficon_large.gif\" alt=\"pdf icon\"></div><h3 style=\"font-size: 8pt\"><a href=\"/cm/popularmechanics/data/classicgardenbench0312.pdf\">Classic Garden Bench Plans</a> (PDF, 10.1MB, requires <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Reader</a>)</a></h3></div>","step_materials":[{"step_material":[{"step_material":"2 x 4 x 8 ft (5 pieces)","__total_count__":9},{"step_material":"1 x 4 x 4 ft (1 piece)","__total_count__":9},{"step_material":"4 x 4 x 8 ft (1 piece)","__total_count__":9},{"step_material":"3/8-in.-dia x 36-in. threaded rod (2)","__total_count__":9},{"step_material":"3/8-in. hex nuts and washers (4 of each).

Using a PC program called 3ds Max, he created a complete 3D model of a labeled, ordered case, custom-fitted for his old tools. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhen he was finished, he sent the file to his desktop prototyper, or 3D printer. About an hour later his tool case materialized in white ABS plastic. Everything fit perfectly. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nVan der Linden, an electrical engineer by training, is admittedly not a beginner: 3ds Max is a professional 3D tool used to create, among other things, computer graphics for Hollywood films such as <i>Iron Man </i>and <i>Avatar</i>, and his 3D printer, the pp3dp Up, retails for more than $2500.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNonetheless, he says, the appeal of DIY 3D modeling and printing is universal. \"You're losing a lot of the limitations in the physical world,\" he says. \"For my whole life, I always wanted to make stuff. Now I can make anything I want.\" It's true: An influx of easy-to-use software and on-demand printing services has made it possible for DIY-minded individuals&#151;not just professional engineers&#151;to render their designs, be they brand-new inventions or just hard-to-find replacement parts, in 3D and have them printed in plastic, glass, or even metal. Here's how to get started. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>3D for the Masse</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>When most people think of 3D modeling</strong></span>, they think of CAD (short for computer-aided design). CAD conjures images of engineers toiling over green-on-black wireframes. This perception isn't entirely unfounded; 3D CAD modeling of the advanced, inscrutable sort has changed what it means to be an engineer and revolutionized everything from toy design to aviation. It has also been, until recently, almost completely inaccessible to civilians.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nToday, though, 3D modeling has quietly opened to the mainstream. Free or affordable tools have emerged that are designed with ordinary people in mind.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMore importantly, these tools have found real, practical roles. Some, like traditional CAD programs, help people&#151;tinkerers, inventors, artists&#151;visualize objects in three dimensions. Others simply help you plan a new room in your home or reconfigure an old one. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>The biggest hurdle for would-be 3D-modelers isn't the price</strong></span> or the complexity of the software&#151;it's the overabundance of options. There are pro-level modeling and rendering suites, finicky engineering tools, and simplified-to-the-point-of-uselessness art apps. In search of an entry point, I found an app called Tinkercad. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThis free application runs inside a Web browser on nearly any PC or Mac and contains just the right level of functionality&#151;it's capable enough for real 3D modeling, but not so complex as to put you off. It's a solid-modeling program&#151;much like most professional CAD apps&#151;which means that its models are an agglomeration of points in space rather than a hollow group of stitched-together polygons. With its emphasis on solid, volumetric materials, this type of modeling is particularly well-suited for 3D printing, and Tinkercad has a button that creates a 3D-printer-ready file instantly.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nTo get started, navigate to <a href=\"http://www.tinkercad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinkercad.com</a> and create a free user account. I was presented with a blank slate&#151;or, in the parlance of 3D modeling, an open work plane. Building in Tinkercad is conceptually simple: In the Add mode, you select a shape&#151;a box, a pyramid, a cone, or a cylinder&#151;along with a size. You then stamp this shape into 3D space; clicking and dragging will stretch the shape as far as you want. The Sub (for \"subtract\") mode lets you use the same shapes for object removal. One of the easiest practical projects is a shirt button: With the Add tool, stamp a disc that's 16 mm wide and 2 mm thick. With the Sub tool set at 3 mm wide and 2 mm thick, stamp out two buttonholes near the center of the disc. That's it.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMy first nonbutton project was admittedly a modest one: a POPULAR MECHANICS paperweight. It was to be about 4 inches wide, with a thick, 1-inch-deep base. Our trademark PM lettering would be perched on top. (Swap for your initials if you want to follow along.)\n\n<br /><br />\n\nModeling a shirt button takes about 2 minutes; my paperweight took a great deal longer&#151;about an hour, including 15 minutes to get used to the app and no small amount of trial and error. Getting used to the stamp-and-cut behavior of the program was the biggest challenge; in its current incarnation, there's no way to move or resize an object&#151;a block, for example&#151;after it's been placed on the grid. Getting the spacing of the letters right took a few tries. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe core of the paperweight was composed of just seven shapes: one block for the base, four blocks for the M, and one block and a disc for the P. After creating the core, it was a matter of cutting, trimming, and adding accents. I subtracted small pieces of material from the middle of the M to match our iconic typography and carved out a hole for the P. I used small cubes to stamp serifs onto the letters and did cleanup with a 1 &#215; 1&#151;mm subtract tool. The end result was good enough. The next step was to make the paperweight real.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>3D Printing</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong><em>Popular Mechanics</em> has devoted a fair number of pages</strong></span> in the past few years to a company called MakerBot, whose 3D printers can create small, plastic prototypes in just a few minutes&#151;all they need is a healthy supply of ABS plastic and a 3D-model template from a program like Tinkercad. MakerBot's machines are affordable, but only relatively: At $1000, they're far cheaper than industrial prototyping machines, but out of reach for most hobbyists&#151;including me. Plus, I was making a paperweight, and MakerBots print only in plastic. I wanted something with heft&#151;glass or stone or even metal. That's where Shapeways, an on-demand 3D printing service, came in. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nSending my model to Shapeways was a two-step process: From Tinkercad I exported my project as an STL file, the industry standard for 3D printing; at <a href=\"http://www.shapeways.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shapeways.com</a> I just clicked the Upload button on the front page. Ten minutes later, I got a message saying that my model had been approved, and I was presented with nearly 20 choices of materials. For $25, I could have the project printed in ceramic. For $930, I could have it cast in sterling silver. I made my selection (sandstone, $36) and I would have my paperweight within two weeks. I've already chosen a followup project: Ever the picky tech editor, I'm custom-designing a case for my smartphone.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Advanced Prototyping</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Software for 3D modeling ranges in price from free</strong></span> to thousands of dollars and varies hugely in complexity. Tinkercad is a fantastic starting point, but you'll hear a lot of other names when you dive into the world of 3D modeling.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSketchUp, by Google, is a popular program by virtue of its tie-in with the company's 3D-mapping program, Google Earth. (Google encourages users to populate its virtual maps with 3D replicas of real buildings.) Blender, another free program, is an open-source alternative to professional programs such as 3ds Max. It's versatile&#151;there's really nothing you can't do in Blender&#151;but it has a steep learning curve.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe app 123D, new from Autodesk, the company that makes the industry-standard professional CAD software, is a well-balanced tool kit for intermediate 3D-modelers and connects natively with Shapeways for easy 3D printing. Once you're comfortable in a program like Tinkercad, you can find your way in 123D.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere's room to grow with Shapeways as well. Once you're satisfied with your design, you can list it for sale on the site. You choose the material options and markup, and they handle the ordering, printing, and shipping. \"Three-D modeling started as a hobby,\" says van der Linden, but after launching a product line that includes kinetic toys, geometric sculpture, jewelry, and desk lamps (Shapeways can print objects up to about 27 &#215; 15 &#215; 22 inches), it's quickly becoming a healthy source of income. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nRoman Vasyliev, a freelance designer, had been building model cars and airplanes for years before discovering 3D printing. His obsessively detailed World War I&#151;era aircraft models now net a steady stream of income. (The top seller is a 1:44-scale model of the Caudron G.4, a French biplane bomber.) \"I was really surprised that 3D modeling has become another branch of my hobby,\" he says, \"and now, my work.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nModeling and printing in 3D has everyday applications, too. In an hour or two, Tinkercad or 123D can help you replace that once-irreplaceable knob on your priceless old guitar amp, for example. Last year a man named Duann Scott asked the manufacturer of his high-end baby stroller, Bugaboo, for a part to repair a broken hub lock. When the company said it would charge $250, he scoffed. Scott took apart the hub, figured out what he needed, modeled the parts on his own, and had them printed in stainless steel. Total cost: $15.","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Herrman","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643765","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

already have a six-pack &#150; you just can't see it yet. It's hidden under the layer of fat that you affectionately refer to as your belly. And you won't be able to enjoy this very 21st-century barometer of health until your gut is gone. In addition to the immediate aesthetic rewards, there is a long-term benefit: a study published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> links excess abdominal fat to a near doubling of the risk of life-threatening diseases in later life. But before you start getting down to the business of removing that blubber, here's a rundown of what actually lies beneath.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Rectus abdominis</h2>\n\n<p>This is the muscle (note the singular) that has come to define fit, in both senses of the word. It starts at your rib cage and stretches down to your pelvis. Function-wise, it's called into play whenever you bring your pelvis closer to your rib cage and vice versa &#150; for example, when you bend over or get up from a prone position. Despite being referred to as a six- or eight-pack, it is one single muscle divided by tendons: three horizontal, one vertical. Terminology aside, ownership of one sends out the message that you're serious about your health and fitness. Which can't be a bad thing.</p>\n\n\n<h2>2. External obliques</h2>\n\n<p>The obliques handle side-to-side movements; swinging a racquet, bat or punch are all actions you can thank these muscles for. They hug the sides of your abs, running diagonally from your lower ribs to your hipbone, and are used when you wheel your upper and lower body or rotate your trunk. Men tend to store fat over these muscles, which can detract from the abs. So although they're not officially part of the six-pack, keeping them lean and toned is essential for a solid midriff.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Internal obliques</h2>\n\n<p>Your internal obliques are unsung heroes, quietly getting on with their job while their external relation gets all the plaudits. Starting at your pelvis and ending at the base of your ribs, they're buried beneath your external obliques and sit at right angles to them. This allows them to protect your spine, acting as shock absorbers when you twist too quickly, while also raising your diaphragm up and down &#150; which is pretty handy if you happen to enjoy breathing.</p>\n\n\n<h2>4. Transverse abdominis</h2>\n\n<p>This is the backbone of your six-pack, sitting beneath your rectus abdominis and acting as a corset that holds your stomach in and keeps your pelvis and lower back stable. It's the weight belt you're born with, protecting your spine and organs while balancing your body. Strengthening it allows you to exercise more efficiently, burn more calories and get that six-pack in less time.

As the basket sits in traffic, a herd of human giraffes&#151;spotted tights, papier-m&#226;ch&#233; heads&#151;sweeps by. Then from behind comes the sound of clanking metal. I turn around to confront a silver sea monster on wheels. Front-mounted lobster claws chomp hungrily, dragon jaws on the roof open wide, and a long tongue of flame scorches the sky.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSuch are the sights of the Kinetic Grand Championship, a three-day event on the northern California coast that is equal parts inventors' showcase, artistic performance, and serious race. It's the Daytona 500 meets Burning Man. Using no motors, the picnic basket, the sea monster, and three dozen other human-powered absurdities will travel 42 miles between the cities of Arcata, Eureka, and Ferndale. Though they look like carnival floats on acid, the contraptions must be designed to drive over pavement, dirt, and sand dunes, and even to navigate moving waters. \"Kinetics is about art, speed, and engineering,\" says Monica Topping, former president of the organization that puts on the race. \"It's the triathlon of the art world.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere are nearly a dozen kinetic races around the United States, from Port Townsend, Wash., to Baltimore, and all were inspired by the Humboldt County event. It was launched in 1969 by local artists Hobart Brown and Jack Mays and first won by a turtle that belched smoke and laid eggs. The event begins at Arcata's main square, where thousands of spectators snap pictures and a marching band plays hits from the 1980s. A slice of cake creeps past a pod of dolphins. A gangster's getaway car moves beside the space shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>. The Heroes of Gloryopolis rolls slowly along with a team of Marvel Comics&#151;esque superheroes patrolling a metropolitan skyline. Ten pilots below pedal bikes welded to the remains of a Ford Ranger chassis. The machine was engineered by resident Carl Mueller, who, like many kinetic racers, has an almost compulsive desire to tinker with everything from Legos to vintage steam locomotives. \"I was born with a wrench in one hand and a gear in the other,\" he says. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/dC/kinetic-championship-02-0312-de.jpg\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:8pt;\"><em>On day two, Visualize Whirled Peas begins to traverse Humboldt Bay with the writer as a co-pilot.</em> (Photo by Mark Peterson)</span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAnd then there's the kinetic sculpture that I'm helping to race. I hunker down in a putrid-green, three-wheeled dune buggy called Visualize Whirled Peas, or VWP for short. Decorated with dangling tennis balls and spinning pinwheels, it has one tire up front and two in the back, and there's a similar configuration of seats for the trio of pilots. To my right is VWP's inventor, Mike Ransom, who built the contraption from donated dirt-track tires, abandoned bikes, and other dumpster-diving finds. Whether they are anticar environmentalists or monster-truck fans, most racers, like Ransom, relish the challenge of turning trash into rolling treasure.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"How many bikes died to make that float?\" a man on the street asks.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Probably about six or seven,\" Ransom says. Each VWP pilot has pedals underfoot and controls a set of either 18 or 21 bicycle gears, which in turn feed into six more gearing ranges. Ransom, a computer programmer at the University of California, Davis, boasts that VWP has 244,944 possible gearing combinations. \"Rube Goldberg would be proud!\" the man replies.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA Kinetic Kop, wearing the buttoned coat and tall hat of a 19th-century British police officer, approaches VWP. He checks that we have the toothbrushes, the horn, the 2-gallon pail, and other items mandated by the gleefully arcane rules of the contest. The inspection ends, and at noon, a siren cuts through the air. Pedaling furiously and jockeying for position, Team VWP makes three laps around the square, then heads west out of town. The race is on.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/burning-man-meets-daytona-in-californias-crazy-gonzo-race-2\">The Next Day >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/86/kinetic-championship-03-0312-aYd632-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-14T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Vlahos","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643770","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/off-the-shelf-breakthrough-award-engineering\">Lessons in Gonzo Engineering from Breakthrough Winners</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/captain-america-gonzo-engineering-behind-red-skulls-monster-car\">Captain America: The Gonzo Engineering Behind Red Skull's Monster Car</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/gonzo/the-daring-engineering-behind-vancouvers-capilano-cliffwalk\">The Daring Engineering Behind Vancouver&rsquo;s Capilano Cliffwalk</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/build-a-gonzo-dot-matrix-printer-that-creates-pointillist-works-of-art\">Build a Gonzo Dot-Matrix Printer That Creates Pointillist Works of Art</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/news/4339228\">The Top 5 Engineering Projects of 2009</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/gonzo/the-72-hour-race-to-build-a-gonzo-people-mover\">The 72-Hour Race to Build a Gonzo People Mover</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/improvement/4256208\">4 Gonzo DIY Creations Get Even Gonzo -er: DIY Rally Update</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/worlds-strangest-architecture-engineering\">The World's Strangest Engineering </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/10-coolest-diy-projects-from-maker-faire-2011\">10 Coolest DIY Projects From Maker Faire 2011</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/infrastructure/top-5-engineering-projects-in-2010\">Top 5 Engineering Projects in 2010</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-29T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:17:43.000Z","author_id":"5596","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/burning-man-meets-daytona-in-californias-crazy-gonzo-race","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Chicken soup is undeniably comforting when you&#146;re battling a cold&#151;but throw fresh ginger in there, and it&#146;s even better.

At the 29th Burton U.S. Open Snowboarding Championship in March, she hit the trick again. Before winning her fifth Open title, Clark did a 900 for our cameras; the trick lasts 2 seconds and was captured in 23 frames (only 13 are shown here). Three decades of advances in half-pipe engineering, physical training, and board design have allowed snowboarders to fly higher and spin more quickly. With Clark's assistance, we break down the mechanics behind snowboarding's new heights.\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1: APPROACH</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\nIn the pipe, riders can travel up to 40 mph, but they have to fight the forces that sap speed. As Clark moves along the arc in the transition from flat bottom to vertical wall, centripetal force pushes her down. Harnessing that force adds speed, but if she buckles, Clark's body absorbs kinetic energy and slows down. As she approaches the pipe's transition&#151;where centripetal force is the highest&#151;Clark pumps her legs. This stiffens her body and causes her to exert more force on the ground, which, according to Newton's third law of motion, pushes back and boosts her speed.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>2: LAUNCH & FLIGHT</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\n\"One of the biggest misconceptions is people liken it to a vertical jump,\" says Jon Turnbull, the winter performance program manager at the New Zealand Academy of Sport. If snowboarders jumped like basketball players, they'd fly away from the wall and toward the center of the pipe, instead of up above the lip. Clark generates height by rotating her body as she reaches the lip, which creates vertical velocity. Once in the air, she pulls her arms close to her body to increase rotation and spin in a fluid motion. \"The more compact I am,\" she says, \"the faster I spin.\"</p>\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>3: LANDING</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\nClark spots her landing two-thirds through a trick. When landing, she must \"?'pull the chute'&#151;you make yourself as big as you can to slow your rotation,\" she says. To maintain speed into the next trick, she reenters the pipe as high on the wall as possible while angling her board down the pipe to take advantage of its 18-degree pitch. When she lands, Clark must keep her body rigid; flexing her knees would absorb energy and decrease her speed. \"She's maintaining her gravitational potential energy from a body of flight and changing it to kinetic energy,\" Turnbull says. \n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>THE BOARD</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\nOnce just crude wooden planks, snowboards have evolved into precisely engineered pieces of equipment. The core is composed of small wooden strips arranged to improve strength and flexibility. Because wood is strongest when bending with the grain, the strips near each end run parallel to the board's length, adding spring. In the center, the grain runs perpendicular so it flexes as the rider leans forward and back. Fiberglass and carbon fiber add strength, and a Teflon-infused epoxy reduces friction. At an event, techs hone a board's edges and bake wax into it overnight: On cold, dry days, when snow is icy, a hard wax is used; on warm, wet days, a softer wax applied with texture prevents suction. \"The board base is absorbent,\" Clark says. \"The more it's waxed, the faster it gets.\"</p>\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/ef/big-air-0312-de.jpg\" />\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>THE PIPE</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\nThe original half-pipes, built in the late '70s, were little more than creek beds that riders modified by shoveling snow. But with the invention of the Pipe Dragon&#151;an excavator with a curved arm&#151;in 1990, carving uniform pipes became easier. As riders pushed for bigger air, the excavators grew to cut larger pipes, progressing from 10- to 12- to 18-foot-high walls and then 22 feet, introduced in 2006. \"The pitch of the 22-foot pipe is steeper, which allows you to carry more speed&#151;it's enabled the progression we've seen in snowboarding,\" Clark says. \"I don't want to go near an 18-foot pipe anymore.\"</p>\n<br /><br

book from <em>MH </em>editors which reveals how to cut thousands of calories from your weekly diet through simple food swaps.</p>\n\n<h2>Eat this</h2>\n\n<p>Pasta has had a bad rap of late, what with Dr Atkins and the low-carb crowd. The truth is, it's a healthy low-fat way to boost energy levels. Pasta only becomes unhealthy when served with creamy sauces and fatty meats that are often found in supermarket ready meals. Our answer? A low-calorie, big-flavour dish that packs an energy punch and that you can pack for lunch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You'll need</strong></p> \n<p>340g penne pasta\n<br />1 tsp olive oil\n<br />220g uncooked chicken sausages, skin removed\n<br />1 medium onion, chopped\n<br />2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n<br />1 medium courgette, sliced into half-moons\n<br />Salt and ground black pepper to taste\n<br />40g sun-dried tomatoes, reconstituted in hot water if not oil-packed\n<br />120ml chicken stock\n<br />45g goat's cheese</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to make it</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until just <em>al dente</em>, meaning &#145;hard bite&#146;. As always, rely on your taste buds&#151;not the package instructions&#151;to determine this.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> While the water heats and the pasta cooks, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and fry until cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Remove and reserve. Add the onion and garlic and cook for a few minutes, until the onion is translucent, then add the courgette and cook until lightly caramelised, about 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, the stock, and the reserved sausage and keep warm until the pasta is ready.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> Drain the pasta and add it directly to the pan with the sausage and vegetables. Cook together for 30 seconds, cut the heat, and sprinkle on the cheese just before serving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>\n<p>480 calories\n<br />11g fat (4g saturated)\n<br />1.5g

Hang at arm's length with your legs bent at the knees and your feet crossed at the ankles. Now pull yourself up until your chin crosses the plane of the bar, then slowly lower without allowing your body to sway.</p>\n\n<h3>Perfect form</h3>\n<p><strong>Upper thighs</strong> Keep your legs hanging in the same position, not allowing them to sway through the movement. Don't jerk your legs upwards to give you momentum as this makes the move easier and may cause injury.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hamstrings</strong> If you cross your legs it might be a good idea to give your hamstrings a quick stretch first. It's an exercise that can induce cramps in the hamstrings owing to the strain put on them when leaning forward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feet</strong> Cross your legs behind you or keep them straight, but don't allow them to touch the floor, as this will release the tension placed on your working muscles. Use your legs to make minor balance adjustments throughout the movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hands</strong> Hold the bars tightly with a sturdy overhand grip that's slightly wider than shoulder-width. Ensure there's no movement in your grip as it could lead to serious injury if it falters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elbows</strong> Slowly and deliberately raise yourself by bending your elbows to a point where your chest is almost touching the bar and your head is above it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Back</strong> Keep your back upright, with your lower back contracted. Do this by pushing out your chest as you raise yourself. When you reach the top of the movement your shoulder blades should be firmly tensed together.</p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite

Below is a conversation we had with the men behind this bizarre but joyful comedy back when they showed it at Sundance in January.</i></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>PARK CITY, Utah &#151;</strong> You might know Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim from <em>Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!</em>, even if you aren't necessarily one of the dedicated fans who stay up watching it every weeknight on Adult Swim at 1:15 in the morning. But the cable niche that the two have carved out is about to get considerably wider with <em>Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie</em>, which features a handful of really famous people, along with their usual absurdity and body humor. We talked to them over the weekend here from the Sundance Film Festival about this new stage of their career, why <em>Top Gun</em> isn't so terrible, and what it's like to make Will Ferrell look new again.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQUIRE.COM:</strong> So when you get on the set, how do you work yourself up to say, \"Okay, I'm sawing my hand off today\"?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC WAREHEIM:</strong> That's fun for us. To be able to write that and execute great special effects &#151; that's dream-come-true stuff. And then to go to a theater and see people screaming and giggling...</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Did you stay during the screening to see how people reacted?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM HEIDECKER:</strong> We popped in and out. The audience was receptive, but when anything doesn't hit with a huge laugh, as comics, it feels like, <em>Oh no, oh no, we're sinking.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> <em>We gotta re-cut this.</em></p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> We have a terrible experience watching the movie because, not only have we seen it a million times, and it feels like walking through molasses, but we want the audience to be screaming.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> So much of the comedy is based on squeamishness and awkward dead air. If the audience is always laughing...</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> They're missing something.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> It's all about anticipation.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> It's the same reason a laugh track doesn't work on our <em>Awesome</em> show. It wouldn't make any sense because the audience laughs at different places, and sometimes it's not about laughing. Sometimes the discomfort is more powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> There's the gut-busting laugh, and then there's the next morning you wake up and realize, <em>Oh my God, this man took another man's son</em> &#151; that's a more heady, psychological laughter we love.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong>&#160;We've been told by friends who see the movie, \"I liked watching it when I was watching it, but the next day or the day after, some of the moments stuck with me and kept looping around in my brain.\" I think there are a lot of things that happen that might not be super-apparent when you're sitting in the theater watching it.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> I was looking at the cast list and saw that one of the characters is played by an actress named <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0135245/\" target=\"_blank\">Twink Caplan</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Where, pray tell, did you find Twink Caplan?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> Twink did a bit on our TV show that didn't air. She was very willing to go the extra mile to do this weird tongue-twisting bit. She fit the character that we wanted &#151; a little bit older, cute, not typically what I would be into. And then she was really awesome in the sex scene.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> I love the introduction of the Spanish fly in that scene. Who thinks of Spanish fly anymore?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> Exactly. It also reveals the stupidity of the characters that he doesn't know what Spanish fly is. It's this new, cool idea&#133;</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> We always want our work to be this timeless moment. You don't really know if it's the '80s or the 2000s. Things like Spanish fly, our outfits &#151; we like to not be relevant with the times.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> I know, when I was a kid, Spanish fly was something you thought about a lot. That's what sex was about.</p>\n\n\n<p><object width=\"460\" height=\"264\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Si-xUeeqqRQ?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0&showinfo=0\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Si-xUeeqqRQ?version=3&hl=en_US&rel=0&showinfo=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> You built a mall for the movie. What was that like?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> Well, it's a real mall in Palm Springs that's been abandoned for years. We got lucky. It was about to be torn down, but that was a couple months away, so we were able to go in there and have it be our playground. It's basically how you see it onscreen. It took a lot of work to do the last couple scenes where it's supposed to look like a fresh, new mall.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> What did the contractors who were cleaning it up think of what you were doing?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> Everyone involved was pretty cool about letting us do our thing. The whole movie is pretty close to what we envisioned.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> I want to try a little word association and see if you can tell me what comes to mind.</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> This is the best.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> One I thought of was body image. Since you guys have a lot of beer guts hanging out.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> It's difficult because I acknowledge how funny it is, how it helps the comedy. But at the same time I'm a human being who has feelings. So this compromise of giving away of some of your personal life to the audience for the joke...</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> One thing we've been very conscious of from the beginning is making ourselves look as horrible as possible, whether it be our bodies or our costuming or our attitudes. We're monsters.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESQ: </strong><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005162/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Loggia</a>, whom I barely recognized, is a different kind of monster in this movie, but he's just as much on that level of caricature.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> He went big. We don't have a rehearsal process, so Robert showed up on set, and we started shooting. We were like, <em>Okay, this is going to be it. Let's embrace it. Let's make this character just crazy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Something else that comes to mind: promotional videos. Where do you get these promotional videos you're riffing on?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> Starting in college, we had a network of people who would share these funny, weird industrial videos &#151; training videos, clips from cable access. We would have screenings of those before YouTube and <a href=\"http://www.everythingisterrible.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Everything Is Terrible</a> were around. We were obsessed with that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p><em>[A waitress comes by.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> That looks pretty good. What is it, a burger?</p>\n<p><strong>WAITRESS:</strong> Yes. <em>[She turns to Eric.]</em> I'm feeding you. Would you like a snack?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> It might be just what we need. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> Oh, it's good.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> Oh, this is like a gourmet Big Mac.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Going back to YouTube, now that people have these outlets to watch all this taboo stuff, does it change the way you look at these videos?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> They're not as special anymore. Everyone's doing that. I've been gravitating toward animal videos only &#151; interspecies play, like a bear and a kitten.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> We get sent so much stuff. People seem to be like, <em>Oh, this is some bad '80s stocking commercial. Aren't you just gonna love it?</em> No, it has to be special. This is a little off-topic, but one fun thing for us with this movie is, we've been doing all these promotional videos, and it's occurred to me that the movie itself is just one piece. The interviews, the commercials, and all these things we've made &#151; I think they all have to be considered in the context of the movie, because it's sort of part of it, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Even though part of the pleasure of the movie is that there is no context in which this stuff makes sense.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> I also wanted to ask about celebrity impersonators. There are at least two I can think of in this movie.</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong>&#160;Well, people always love celebrity impersonators, but the role of Johnny Depp &#151; we did go out to Johnny Depp, and Tom Cruise. Our original idea was to have a big, crazy name to stir up the movie. Then we realized that an impersonator is way funnier.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> For a moment, I wasn't really sure if it was Depp or not, whether it was him trying to look like an impersonator. You also worked with the actual John C. Reilly, who plays Taquito. What was that like?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> I think he likes working with us because it's very collaborative, and he gets to contribute a lot to it. It's a lot of him improvising, his ideas. Taquito &#151; he really wanted to contribute a lot to the way that character talked and looked like. He's not just an actor showing up to read something somebody else wrote. He's invested in it creatively.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Whose idea was it to have Will Ferrell watch <em>Top Gun</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> It just seemed so broad and timeless and ... irrelevant.</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong>&#160;<em>[laughs]</em> That mall felt very '80s. We thought it might be a video they'd have around.</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong>&#160;It's not a terrible movie. It's not like, <em>Oh, do you wanna watch </em>Striptease? It's like, <em>Yeah, I guess I'll watch</em> Top Gun. It's not a bad movie. It's okay.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Ferrell is everywhere these days. When you're working with him, do you think at all about what he's done recently or his image?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong>&#160;<em></em>We do a refresher course in what he's done character-wise. It's hard. You're putting a wig or a moustache on. You want it to not just be Will Ferrell sitting there. You want to create something new. He's done so much, and a lot of it is so great. I think we have an awareness of not wanting to rip off an old Will Ferrell character. But I think he's fresh in this movie, and so fucking funny in a way you don't usually see. He's very serious and kind of crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Do you think having more cast, more story &#151; more of everything, basically &#151; changed the way you work together?</p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong>&#160;<em></em>It was mainly time constraints. Everything was tightened. It restricted us in the time we had to improvise. We're in almost every scene, so it's hard to look at tapes. We had to trust our guys to make sure we got it. This is a little less experimental than our show. It's based more on budgets and schedules.</p>\n<p><strong>ESQ:</strong> Did you not review footage after shooting?</p>\n<p><strong>TIM:</strong> We did, but it was slightly irrelevant, because there wasn't time built into redoing things. If we saw something we didn't like, we were just like, <em>Okay, nothing we can do about that.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ERIC:</strong> The most important thing was, since this was our first movie, I went through to make sure we're consistent. Our characters are crazy, but they have some sort of dynamic throughout the whole thing that makes them believable.</p>\n\n<p><b><i><a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/sundance-2012/\" alt=\"sundance 2012 interviews\">Stay Tuned to Esquire.com for More Conversations from Sundance with Spike Lee, William H.

book from <em>MH </em>editors which reveals how to cut thousands of calories from your weekly diet through simple food swaps.</p>\n<h2>Eat this</h2>\n<p>Pre-prepared salads suffer from a double dose of shamefulness: they are not only boring and sloppily executed, they often come with more calories and fat than your average bacon cheeseburger. Here, we harvest the big flavours of the East &#8211; sweet, spicy, tart, cool &#8211; but leave all the excessive calories out of the equation. A generous portion of lean flank steak and creamy cubes of avocado make sure this salad truly satisfies.</p>\n<p><strong>You'll need</strong></p>\n<p>450g flank steak (ask your butcher, this great-value cut is under used) <br />Salt and ground black pepper to taste <br />1 tsp sriracha or other hot sauce <br />2 tsp honey <br />1/2 tsp reduced-salt soy sauce <br />Juice of 1 lime <br />60 ml canola oil <br />1 bag watercress <br />1 small punnet of cherry tomatoes, sliced in half <br />1 small red onion, thinly sliced <br />1/2 cucumber, thinly sliced <br />1 avocado, peeled, pitted, and chopped <br />Handful of fresh coriander leaves</p>\n<p><strong>How to make it</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat a grill, grill pan, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Season the flank steak all over with salt and pepper and cook until medium rare, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing thinly across the natural grain of the meat.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> While the meat rests, combine the sriracha, honey, soy sauce, and lime juice with a pinch of pepper in a mixing bowl. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking to combine.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> In a large salad bowl, combine the watercress, tomatoes, onion, cucumber, avocado, coriander, and sliced steak and slowly drizzle in the dressing, tossing the ingredients gently with each addition, until everything is lightly coated.</p>\n<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>\n<p>430 calories <br />31g fat (6g saturated) <br />1.14g salt</p>\n<h2>Not that</h2>\n<p>Tesco chicken &amp; bacon layered salad</p>\n<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>\n<p>600 calories <br />40g fat (4g saturated) <br />1.4g salt</p>\n<p><a title=\"Eat This, Not That!\" href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/books/eat-this-not-that-book-2012\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more information about our new book, <em>Eat This, Not That!</em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></span></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-03-01T07:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11281","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6631859","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/food-nutrition/asian-beef-salad\">Eat This, Not That: Asian beef salad </a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/londons-healthiest-restaurants-304978\">London&rsquo;s healthiest restaurants</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/healthy-salad-dressing\">Go full-fat for a healthier salad </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/healthy-curry-recipes\">The four healthiest curry recipes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/eat-to-beatblood-pressure-highs-lows-349567\">Eat to beat...blood pressure highs and lows</a><br>\n<a href=\"/healthy/mh-investigates-the-obesity-problem\">MH investigates: Obesity in the UK</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/healthiest-fast-food-options\">The healthiest fast food options</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/eat-salad-live-longer-83688\">Eat salad , live longer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/the-ultimate-muscle-building-salad\">The ultimate muscle-building salad </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/zaatar-chicken-a-fattoush-salad-344550\">Zaatar chicken with a fattoush salad </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"Eat This Not That book, p254","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:31:35.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-03T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/what-to-eat/asian-beef-salad","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"It was a party people talked about for weeks: whose stockings were striped, whose sapphires shined bright, whose pants were diamond-studded.

13-year-old Lucy Matz seems as one with&#160;her pony Finesse, as they gallop after a pack of hounds through the rolling Pennsylvania countryside, it's not just because Lucy has been sitting in the saddle since she was one. \"I did show jumping when I was two months pregnant with her,\" says her mother, D.D. Matz, as the two prepare for the hunt with scores of other members of Mr. Stewart's Cheshire Foxhounds one cool Saturday morning. \"And I rode until I was seven months. By then I was so big no one wanted to give me a leg up.\"</p>\n\n<p>D.D. has a strong pedigree in the horse world herself. Her grandfather, Robert Kleberg Jr., was president of Texas's King Ranch &#151; for a time a leading landowner in Chester County, where many Main Line Philadelphia families own large farms. Her grandmother was a fox hunter, and her mother, Helen Groves, grew up on King Ranch and was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1998 as the First Lady of Cutting. Her husband, Michael Matz, a three-time Olympic equestrian and silver medalist in 1996, is an accomplished trainer; he guided Barbaro to a win at the Kentucky Derby. But as a rule it's the mothers who teach the next generation to ride to the hounds.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Emily Hannum went fox hunting with her mother in England before moving to the U.S., where she met her future husband, Jeb Hannum, grandson of the fabled \"Mrs. Hannum,\" a granddaughter of E.H. Harriman who was master of the hunt for 55 years. Today Emily goes riding with her girls, Chloe, 9, and Flora, 5. Both of Jennifer Jones Arms's parents still ride in the hunt, even though they've divorced, and Jennifer rides with son Graham, 11, and daughter Haven, 9. Cindy Buchanan, a veterinarian, is an accomplished polo player when not on a horse alongside daughters Audrey, 10, and Maggie, 8.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the hunt has been instrumental in preserving large tracts of land, more than 30,000 contiguous acres. Much of it belongs, or once belonged, to families such as the du Ponts, Harrimans, and Strawbridges, or their descendants. Today Cheshire Foxhounds is thriving. The hunts are held three days a week during the season and last several hours, until the foxes go to ground to be chased another day. \"People may not move to Unionville for the fox hunting,\" says Cheshire board member Don Cochran, \"but our growth is within the hunt.

They'd been visiting the Maccarone gallery in Greenwich Village, she said, when they found themselves in front of an installation: a chocolate factory by the always naughty performance artist Paul McCarthy that was turning out identical little candy treats in the shape of a fat, beaming St. Nick holding a sex toy. What was that in Santa's hands, her children begged to know?</p><p>My friend was hardly a prude, and I searched in vain for a high-minded response to her reaction to this work of wicked provocation (the title of which it seems better not to mention). As it happened, I'd recently been given just such a chocolate as a friendly, um, stocking stuffer. (Thanks, Secret Santa.) Now I wondered if I should eat it privately on Christmas Eve or just tuck it away in a closet before anyone of tender sensibilities laid eyes on it.</p><p>Whatever one's response to such a spectacle may be, McCarthy had done something that's hard to do these days: offend someone who would not generally be considered a philistine. Pushing the boundaries of taste and acceptability is as old as Pompeii, where the cultural elite of the day enjoyed dining and bathing below colorful mosaics of sexual engagement. Work that skirts the edges of the pornographic or toys with the obscene has a pedigree as long as some royal families. But how to react to such work when you find it surprisingly on display at a dinner party, or on the wall of someone's house when you drop off your four-year-old for a birthday party, has become a bit more complicated. </p>\n\n<p>This issue is not trivial to Scotland Yard. In 2009 it pulled a 1992 Richard Prince piece &#151; the appropriation artist had simply reframed the original Garry Gross photograph of a naked and underage Brooke Shields &#151; from the Tate Modern's \"Pop Life\" exhibition. But now that collecting art has become a national pastime for the private-equity set &#151; whether they live in New York, London, or Benton, Arkansas &#151; and a younger and more voracious class of collectors has established itself, many are eager to follow wherever their favorite artists lead, and there's been no shortage of bad boy (and bad girl) practitioners to meet the demand. Some simply play with dicey materials or push their work just past the edge more artfully than their peers. Admiration for this work is not unanimous outside Scotland Yard, either. There are those, for instance, who argue that these artists are using the sanctity of art's mantle to indulge in adolescent acts of transgression. There are others who consider adolescent acts of transgression pretty rock 'n' roll. But with collecting becoming more commonplace, it's almost statistically inevitable that these works will raise <i>somebody's</i> eyebrows over dinner &#151; a boss, a neighbor, the parent of your child's best friend, a prospective in-law. </p>\n\n<p>One common reaction is to ignore the obvious and uncomfortable, but kids are especially ready to respond, often quite loudly. One friend calls this type of occasion the \"Weiner moment,\" after the time a nine-year-old invited his parents' dinner companions to come to his bedroom and \"inspect his Weiner\" &#151; referring to an otherwise chaste text piece that conceptual artist Lawrence Weiner had painted on his wall. The gutsier the collection, the more likely the Weiner moment. Marty Eisenberg, an executive at Bed Bath and Beyond and a voracious bellwether collector of contemporary art, was having dinner with his wife and parents a few years ago at their Scarsdale, New York, home. \"We were seated around the kitchen table eating,\" Eisenberg says, \"when my mother looked up and commented on a provocative image hanging on the wall. My daughter Suzanne, who was eight at the time, said, 'That's nothing. You should see the painting of those lesbians sucking on each other's nipples that's hanging in their bedroom' &#151; a dead-on reference to Nicole Eisenman's <i>Tunnel of Love</i>, which was above our dresser. We changed topics immediately.\"</p>\n\n<p>The exchange goes both ways. The artist Walton Ford, a social satirist of sorts whose Audubon-like watercolors frequently depict animals in compromising and flagrantly sexual situations, recalled that his father was always bragging about his son's success but couldn't bring himself to show the art to the family, thanks to a nonagenarian aunt who could not be counted on to admire a 10-by-20-foot piece depicting an elephant with an oversize erection. \"A book of my work would come out, and it would be like, 'Aw, man, I can't show this to Aunt Frances!' \" Ford says. \"I should have just gotten hold of a catalog and cut the pages out myself.\"</p>\n\n<p>One dealer told me that he'd recently come to realize that the canvas he had by a prominent Manhattan artist that featured Freud on the receiving end of a stream of urine might not be the thing to have up during a playdate. \"The nanny has alluded to the fact that the other nannies think we're crazy,\" he says. Even when kids aren't involved, many collectors adopt a better-safe-than-sorry strategy. \"A few years ago I was hosting a benefit for New York senator Charles Schumer,\" collector Joe Barron recalls. \"And I had Piotr Uklanski's <i>The Nazis</i> &#151; a frieze of 122 portraits depicting actors (Yul Brynner, Ronald Reagan, and Charles Bronson among them) portraying various shades of Gestapo, SS officers, and Hitler Youth &#151; hanging in the apartment.\" \"I thought I should call the senator's office to make sure he knew I was not a Nazi.\" In the end, the piece stayed up, Schumer and his entourage said nothing of it, and to this day no one has accused Barron of National Socialist Party membership. </p><p>Certainly one clause in the social contract involves going out of one's way not to offend one's neighbors, but what are the options when it can't be avoided? One is to chalk it up to what makes contemporary art interesting, and not worry about it too much. Nancy Magoon (and her husband Bob, a retired ophthalmologist and onetime record-setting offshore power boat racing champ) proudly keeps the bulk of her collection, which includes a number of envelope-pushing works (both politically and sexually) by the likes of Tracey Emin, Tim Noble and Sue Webster, and the Chapman Brothers on view in her Aspen home. \"I subscribe to the Christo philosophy,\" she jokes. \"People don't look at it until it's covered up.\" </p>\n\n<p>Subterfuge is another time-honored, if imperfect, practice. When, in the mid-1950s, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan acquired Gustave Courbet's <i>L'Origine du Monde</i> &#151; one of the most daring masterpieces of the 19th century &#151; he cunningly asked his stepbrother, Surrealist painter Andr&#233; Masson, to design a wooden panel to cover the canvas (which now hangs in the Mus&#233;e d'Orsay). But Masson duplicated the full-frontal pose of the model in the painting, and Lacan wound up with a covering as lurid as the work it concealed. There's also the famous story of the Greek tycoon Stavros Niarchos, who did such an immaculate job of keeping Balthus's 1934 <i>The Guitar Lesson</i> cloistered in the boudoir of his Fifth Avenue mansion that this scene of sapphic sadism was long thought lost, before its hiding place was revealed in the 1990s. This is a problem not just for private collections but for gallery shows, too. When Luxembourg & Dayan recently exhibited \"Made in Heaven,\" Jeff Koons's 1991 series of photos of coital bliss with his then-wife, the porn star Cicciolina (n&#233;e Ilona Staller), the gallery was flooded with a type of visitor not often seen trolling the Upper East Side art scene after the show was featured as a must-see in a XXX guide of things to do while visiting New York. \"We had to hide the catalog,\" says the gallery's director, Alissa Bennett.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes tastes differ even between spouses. \"When our Chapman Brothers piece was shipped,\" one gracious collector told me, \"my husband opened up the package. He was so taken aback that he put it in the closet, and it remained there.\" The owner is happy to display her Schieles and Currans but admits that their example of the Chapmans' work, with its preteen nudity and freak show mutations, now resides permanently behind locked doors in their Upper East Side apartment. \"For those I don't think will be totally shocked, I'll give them the key,\" she says. Still, the solution isn't fail-safe. \"We have grandchildren who found out where the key was and liked to show it to their friends.\"</p>\n\n<p>But who wants to keep a favorite work locked up in a closet? The financial analyst Alvin Hall decided to divest himself of an early photograph by Katy Grannan of a Botticelli-esque nude with a not-so-Renaissance-era bikini wax. Hall, who is African-American, says, \"A lot of my black friends would come over and say, 'Alvin, why do you want a picture of a naked white woman hanging in your apartment?' I just saw it as a work, but a lot of these friends were bothered by it. They were intrigued by the waxing in particular.\" He eventually grew tired of the entreaties and, much as he loved the piece, sold it to a single-father friend with a young child. Now he wonders what the current owner tells his &#151; and his kid's &#151; guests.</p>\n\n<p>Lubricious art can at least serve as an effective friendship filter. Defriending is one fast solution. \"I give no consideration to where I put art based on guests' sensitivities,\" Barron says. \"Anyone who has a bad reaction, I'd show them the door.\" Ford adds that he'd just as soon not know when somebody was offended. \"I've had collectors who turn a work down because of the content &#151; they've got kids, etc.,\" he says. \"I tell the gallery basically not to tell me about it anymore.\" But maybe those collectors are missing out on more than a dirty smirk. The owner of the closeted Chapmans work is now proud of its powerful effect. \"It aroused my grandchildren's curiosity, and in many ways it got them interested in art. They can relate to figurative work. That's not always the case with abstract paintings.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it may be that people aren't as easily offended as they used to be, that so many instances of highly refined pornography have inured the majority of viewers &#151; Scotland Yard excepted &#151; to any remaining shock value. In the Time Warner building in New York, a 12-foot-tall male nude Botero sculpture has become a kind of kitschy tourist magnet. The statue is twice life-size, which leaves many visitors at an unfortunate eye level. Yet so many have taken the opportunity to rub the sculpture in that no longer private area that the dark bronze patina on that particular segment of the anatomy has to be regularly restored. </p>\n\n<p>But sometimes it's not sex that riles up the citizenry. For the Aspen neighbors of the Magoons, what really crossed the line wasn't the dicey artwork on their walls but the Nancy Rubins sculpture made of hot water tanks and pipe fittings that they installed on their lawn. In the art world, the work is seen as a wry domestic commentary on a muscular sculptural tradition. But on a neighbor's lawn, it can be viewed as junk. \"We've got a Noble and Webster with penises all over it,\" Nancy Magoon says. \"But they made us out to be pariahs over those hot water tanks.\"</p>","article_links":[{"video_link":"","__total_count__":1,"slideshow_link":""}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite - Article 2.0 (Video Article)","publish_date":"2012-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"22920","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Banks","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dsela","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_two_video","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643786","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/provocative-art-collections\">That's Awkward !</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/art-collectors-and-dealers\">The Players' Club</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/art-basel-miami-beach-2012\">Party Arty</a><br>\n<a href=\"/oaxaca-mexico-jan08\">Oaxaca: Authentic Mexico</a><br>\n<a href=\"/the-scene/weddings/bachelorette-party-destinations\">Girls Gone Mild: Four Low-Key Bachelorette Party Destinations</a><br>\n<a href=\"/the-scene/event-calendar\">Event Calendar</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/politics/financial-crisis-in-greece\">Aegean Blues</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/politics/plum-posts\">Plum Posts</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/small-town-stories-summer-2012\">Scoop Season</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/money-and-power/how-the-wealthy-hide-assets\">What Money?

In the tradition of their predecessors Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos, they tend to brag about their wealth, their art collections, their palatial homes, and the fact that Greek shipowners command the biggest merchant fleet on earth and that their vessels reach every corner of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>\"Ninety-five percent of all goods transported in the world today are carried by ships, and Greeks own 17 percent of those ships,\" boasts Nicos Vernicos, a fourth-generation shipowner. \"That means that 15 percent of all goods transported are carried on Greek ships. In this one thing, and this one thing only, we are ahead of every other country on earth.\" (The Japanese, with nearly 16 percent of shipping, are a close second.) But these days, getting Greek shipowners to talk about their wealth &#151; or how they might pitch in to solve the massive economic problems of a country teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, the aftershocks from which would threaten the financial health of the entire European Union &#151; is like trying to interview ayatollahs in Iran about their country's nuclear research program.</p>\n\n\n<p>The burning question is, will the shipowners, by far the wealthiest sector of the Greek people, make the sort of financial investment at home that could save their country? The answer has not been forthcoming. For almost two years now the Union of Greek Shipowners has urged its members to avoid talking to the press at all. When a Greek shipowner does open up, as Thanasis Laskaridis did with me (he owns 58 ships with his brother Panos), it can be seen as an act of personal rebellion. \"I'm going to be 60 next year,\" Laskaridis says, \"and I'm not going to watch what's going on in this country and keep silent.\"</p>\n\n<p>Most Greek tycoons, However, are following the union's advice to keep their opinions to themselves. The vow of silence certainly suits their needs. At a time when the desperate Greek populace is rioting almost daily to protest severe austerity measures, any confession of a sumptuous lifestyle by the Golden Greeks could cause them serious trouble.</p>\n\n\n<p>The dangers of flaunting wealth in public were illustrated in June 2010, when Leon Patitsas, a scion of the Lemos shipping dynasty, decided to celebrate his wedding to a former Miss Greece with a lavish party in Piraeus, the world's third-largest passenger port, some 12 miles outside Athens, on a historic battleship belonging to the Greek navy. Greek shipowners from all over had gathered in Piraeus for the biennial trade fair called Posidonia, so the young British-born Patitsas invited them on board. There was champagne and lobster, sushi and caviar, and to his lasting embarrassment, there was also a gatecrasher who worked for a Greek tabloid. The next day its pages were filled with photos of the opulent party, with descriptions of some of the women present as \"party girls\" and \"ex-Playmates.\" Soon the then-minister of national defense, Evangelos Venizelos, issued a statement calling the event \"heavily insulting\" to the Greek navy and to \"the patriotic sensitivity\" of the Greek people.</p>\n\n\n<p>All the commotion incensed the average Greek, who is easily incensed these days. Only a few weeks earlier, Greek television had broadcast nonstop images of the May 5 riots in Athens, when more than 100,000 people gathered in Constitution Square to protest the austerity measures and tried to storm Parliament. Throwing chunks of marble torn from the steps of nearby hotels, Molotov cocktails, and broken bottles, they battled police armed with tear gas and clubs. Some of the rioters bombed a bank branch not far away, killing three bank employees, including a pregnant woman.</p>\n\n<p>The photographs of the Patitsas party were a stark contrast to the plight of ordinary Greeks, who had suffered severe reductions in salaries and pensions under austerity measures imposed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Patitsas eventually made a public apology, but powerful shipowners were furious that they were being treated as scapegoats.</p>\n\n<p>No wonder the Union of Greek Shipowners passed the word: no more talking to the press, no more photos of luxurious parties, and from now on keep your wealthy lifestyle out of the public eye.</p>\n\n<p>The union, however, does talk frequently with government officials, according to the man charged with overseeing the shipping industry for the Greek government, Michalis Chrisohoidis, the minister of development, competitiveness, and shipping. The intense, square-jawed 56-year-old lawyer won recognition earlier in the decade as the minister of public order who led the capture of Greece's most violent terrorist group, November 17, which had operated for 30 years without a single arrest.</p>\n\n<p>During our interview a few months ago, amid the Old World elegance of the Grande Bretagne Hotel's Winter Garden, in Athens, I asked Chrisohoidis how willing shipowners were to make investments in Greece and to spur development. He took a sip from his espresso, and his brow furrowed. &#147;Here is what I want to say,&#148; he finally began. &#147;We, as a government and as a nation, share a common goal with our shipowners: to keep Greek shipping number one in the world, because each year it contributes between $15 billion and $18 billion to our economy.&#148;\n\n<p>Pressed for a more direct answer &#151; were they willing to help? &#151; he left room for doubt about the shipowners' commitment. \"We are hopeful that they'll be motivated to play a major role in helping Greece, now that the economic future of our people is at stake, as Greek shipowners in the past have always done at critical times for our nation.\"</p>\n\n<p>The legacy of their heroic forebears is a formidable one, and it poses both a challenge and a burden to today's tycoons, who are expected by many to be as magnanimous as their predecessors. The history of such selflessness dates from 1821, when Greece struggled to free itself from 400 years of Ottoman rule in the country's War for Independence.</p>\n\n<p>At the start of that revolt, the Greek shipping communities on the Aegean islands, which did a brisk business carrying goods between the Ottoman Empire and Europe, had just over 300 armed merchant ves- sels, employing 12,000 sailors. The shipowners contributed their ships and their fortunes to the war effort, converting many of their vessels into fire ships (bourlotes), to be set ablaze and steered into the midst of Ottoman convoys.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most colorful of those shipowners was Laskarina Bouboulina, the 50-year-old widow of a sea captain. During the eight-year war (1821&#150;29) she commanded eight ships, participated in many battles, and was ultimately awarded the rank of admiral. Today a statue of the war heroine reigns over the harbor in Spetses.</p>\n\n\n<p>During World War II, the Greek shipowners once again came to the aid of their country, turning over their fleets to the Allies. Almost 70 percent of these conscripted vessels were sunk by Nazi U-boats as they carried Allied war materiel across the Atlantic. In recognition of the owners' sacrifice, after the war the United States allowed them to buy 100 Liberty ships for only $125,000 of their own cash, with the remainder covered by loans guaranteed by the Greek government.</p>\n\n<p>These new fleets quickly expanded, and the Greek officers and seamen the shipowners hired sent critical remittances back home to the country at a time when it was struggling to recover not only from the brutal Nazi occupation but from a devastating civil war triggered by Communist insurgents, a double blow that in the 1950s left much of the country in abject poverty.</p>\n\n<p>When that civil war ended, newly wealthy shipowners like Onassis and Niarchos, brothers-in-law at the time but also fierce rivals, made some of the first major investments in Greece to help jump-start its postwar economy. Onassis bought a small company that had three single-engine airplanes, renamed it Olympic Airways, and built it into a renowned international carrier. Niarchos tried to outdo him by building the country's first shipyard.</p>\n\n<p>Both tycoons continued to make investments in Greece throughout their lives, creating thousands of well-paying jobs. In fact, on the day after Onassis married Jackie Kennedy, in 1968, he didn't go on a honeymoon &#151; he spent his time negotiating a $400 million investment deal with the military junta then ruling Greece. He even courted the junta's leader, Georgios Papadopoulos, by inviting him and his wife to dine with the new Mrs. Onassis on their island.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout their lives, Onassis and Niarchos competed for women, real estate, ever larger yachts (the 190-foot Creole for Niarchos, the 325-foot Christina for Onassis), and private islands (Skorpios for Onassis, Spetsopoula for Niarchos). After they died the competition continued, as their various philanthropies focused on building projects at home and on expanding studies of Greece and its heritage throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p>Onassis left half his estate, worth about $1 billion when he died, in 1975, to a foundation named for his son Alexander, who had died two years earlier in a plane crash. It endowed the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, in Athens, the first hospital in Greece certified to do heart and lung transplants. And the Onassis Foundation just completed the 194,000-square-foot Onassis Cultural Center, in Athens, and awards 135 scholarships per year to Greek postgraduate students.</p>\n\n<p>When Niarchos died, in 1996, he had an estimated net worth of $5 billion. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation has made grants in the arts, education, health, and medicine to the tune of $1.2 billion to date. Its most ambitious project is the $800 million Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, now being built in Athens. Designed by architect Renzo Piano, it will include new homes for the National Library of Greece and the Greek National Opera.</p>\n\n<p>This is quite a legacy to live up to for Greece's 900 shipowning families, who command the largest shipping fleet in the world, ruling an industry whose income is carefully hidden, but the annual gross revenues of which are estimated at $60 billion. What are they doing to help their country as it faces economic catastrophe and their countrymen endure severe reductions in their standard of living?</p>\n\n<p>\"They are doing practically nothing,\" says an Athenian executive who doesn't want to be identified because he has business dealings with several shipowners. \"They're investing little of their money inside Greece, creating few jobs beyond the positions they need to maintain their Greek offices, buying no Greek bonds, and paying absolutely no taxes on the earnings from their ships and nowhere near the taxes they should pay on their assets inside the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>Those shipowners who would discuss the crisis with me, like Nicos Vernicos and his brother George, whose family has been in shipping since 1850, denounce such criticism. \"Any charges that Greek shipowners have not been helping their country are blatantly false, as one fact alone shows,\" insists George Vernicos, whose searching gaze and weathered features reveal his ties to the sea. \"In the last 10 years Greek shipowners have brought into the country about $178 billion in foreign exchange through money spent by their Greek offices, salaries paid to Greek crews, purchases made from Greek companies, taxes paid on Greek-flag vessels, and extensive real estate they have bought. What other group has brought that kind of money into the country, or even come close?\"</p>\n\n<p> One reason shipowners often give to explain why they're not investing more in Greece is that the returns from shipping itself aren't that great these days. \"Since 2008 rates have been in a free fall, with earnings well below break-even levels in many areas,\" says Basil Papachristidis, a Canadian-born shipowner whose father sold 10 frigates to Onassis in 1946, one of which was later converted into the Christina. \"Banks are calling in loans, seizing ships, and causing owners to lose their entire equity. It is quite possible a number of owners will go bankrupt in the next 12 to 18 months.\"</p>\n<p>But he and other industry experts concede that the big shipping families are well diversified and are not in any real financial trouble, since they piled up huge cash reserves earlier in the decade, when rates soared tenfold in just a few years. And they know how to squeeze out profits even in hard times, as Onassis did during the Great Depression. He broke into shipping in 1932, when he bought six Canadian freighters for $30,000 each &#151; essentially their scrap value &#151; and kept them working through the decade.</p> \n\n<p>If all that's true, why haven't the major shipowners used more of their profits to make investments in Greece, create jobs, and help revive the Greek economy?</p>\n\n<p>\"Look, no one is making big investments in Greece,\" says Nicos Vernicos. \"And that is mainly the fault of the politicians and the unions, because they have made Greece an extremely difficult place to do business.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the past, several major shipowners have made sizable investments in the country. They include the Chandris family, who have built hotels; the Latsis family, who have bought banks (and have loaned their 405-foot yacht, the Alexander, to such eminences as Prince Charles, George H.W. Bush, and even Marlon Brando); the Constantakopoulos family, who are building the biggest resort in the country; and the Laskaridis family, who have invested in hotels, casinos, and an airline.</p>\n\n<p>But even these committed Greek shipowners have cautionary tales to tell about investing in their homeland. Most of them are reluctant to speak on the record, but not Thanasis Laskaridis, who, with his brother Panos, owns the landmark Grande Bretagne Hotel in Athens and a 20 percent interest in Aegean Airlines, in addition to their 58 ships.</p>\n\n<p>After doing well in shipping, the Laskaridis brothers decided to make extensive investments in their homeland. \"Our motivation was initially a general desire for new, well-set-up, well-capitalized, and profitable landmark projects that would generate several thousand new jobs in Greece and involve also substantial foreign multinationals and their know-how,\" Thanasis says. The brothers' total investments in Greece at one point reached \"in excess of $1 billion,\" he says, and they created more than 3,500 jobs and produced huge benefits for the country, including $700 million in tax revenues from two casinos.</p>\n\n<p>\"As time went by,\" Thanasis says, \"we started losing the multi-nationals, other than in a management capacity, because Greece is chaotic, corrupt, and unfriendly toward foreign investors.\" The reason Greece is in such a sad state, he says, is that its economy is under the tight control of an oligarchy of \"no more than 10 families and no more than 10 unions...who have systematically fought and destroyed any serious effort by any outsiders, including Greek shipowners, to establish themselves as major players in the country&#146;s economy.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Shipowners are clever, and, generally, wealthy people have no desire, when they are achieving miracles all over the world, to be treated like idiotsintheirowncountry,\" he says. \"If you want to know why they don't make major investments in Greece, look at the labor laws, look at the exit of almost all multinationals &#151; and there were never that many &#151; look at the press barons and how they use their influence to get government contracts for their other business interests, look at the total destruction of value of private equity investment in Greece.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally, he says, look at the fact that the last elected government of Greece took the ministries of shipping and tourism, the most productive engines in the Greek economy, and folded them into other ministries. \"It's as if Saudi Arabia had disbanded its oil ministry!&#148; he exclaims.</p>\n\n<p>The absurdity, cronyism, and corruption that dominate Greek political life have moved Laskaridis's family to reduce their investments in Greece by about 70 percent, he says. \"Our core activity [shipping] is a global and highly competitive business, so problems including corruption were not new to us. However, tolerating such practices in our own homeland was simply unacceptable, as well as hugely damaging psychologically.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the more disturbing sights, he notes, is seeing the marble steps in front of his family's historic Grande Bretagne Hotel, in the heart of Athens on Constitution Square, being torn up by extremists so they could throw pieces at the police during violent demonstrations, which occur on a regular basis these days.</p>\n\n<p>His family spent $300 million to buy and another $115 million to renovate the hotel and make it one of the best in Europe in time for the 2004 Olympics, he says, but the failure of the government to provide a safe and stable operating environment for it hardly motivates the Laskaridises to make any further investments in the country.</p>\n\n<p>\"Greek shipowners will not throw good money after bad,\" he says. \"Please be sure that we will all repatriate capital when, at the very least, we can walk to the center of our city without risk of physical violence. This is the least we demand, and it is not that hard to achieve. Everyone but Greece has done it.\"</p>\n<p>One major Greek shipowner, however, never let the frustrations that come with trying to invest in Greece deter him from pursuing his vision &#151; to uplift his native region &#151; even though it took him 25 years to realize it. The man was Vassilis Constantakopoulos, and his dream was to make Navarino Bay, on the western coast of the Peloponnese, an international tourist destination of the first rank. Although only half of the planned resort complex is finished, it has already begun to earn that distinction, with listings in many travel magazines as one of the top 10 luxury resorts in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Captain Vassilis, as he is known, died in January 2011, only a year after the opening of his eco-friendly resort, Navarino Dunes, the first of four sites at Costa Navarino, a dream that took him a lifetime to achieve. I learned his story from two of his three sons: Costis, who runs Costamare, the family's shipping fleet, and Achilles, who directs its tourist facilities. (The third, Christos, runs the family's mining operations.)</p>\n\n<p>I met the brothers in the conference room of Costamare's modern headquarters between Athens and Piraeus. Costis, 42, a lean, reserved engineer, and Achilles, an outgoing 40-year-old with a staccato delivery, did not need much prodding to talk about their father.</p>\n\n<p>They said Vassilis was born in a small village some 40 miles from where he would later commit $1.3 billion to build his tourist mecca, which will ultimately include five hotels, four golf courses, luxury villas, a sports complex, and a marina.</p>\n\n<p>\"My father left at 13 for Athens,\" Costis says. \"He worked at three jobs &#151; selling buttons, delivering milk, and busing tables &#151; to survive while going to night school. Then he became a deckhand and worked his way up to seaman, engineer, and finally captain.&#148;</p>\n\n<p>In 1962 Vassilis met his future wife, Carmen, a stewardess on Olympic Airways, and they married two years later. When they started a family in 1969, he decided to look for work that would keep him closer to home.</p>\n\n<p>Carmen persuaded him to abandon his first idea &#151; opening a grocery store &#151; and go into the business he knew: shipping. He bought his first small vessel, a 2,000-ton cargo ship, which he named Carmen, in 1974, and slowly began adding others. &#147;He quickly saw that the Greeks who were focused on cargo ships, bulk carriers, and tankers were struggling for charters then, but Northern Europeans who were shifting to containers were doing much better,\" Costis explains. \"So he decided to concentrate on container ships.\"</p>\n\n<p>As his fleet grew, he began ordering new container vessels from shipyards in East Asia, and he was one of the first to spot the boon that an expanding Chinese economy offered for shipping. Eventually he started chartering many of his ships to the Chinese state shipping group, COSCO, which propelled him to the forefront of container shipping.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout these boom years, says Costis, Vassilis was always looking for opportunities to help his country. \"He wanted to do something in his home area, something that would help people there,\" Achilles says. \"And he decided that the way to achieve both goals was to make the Navarino coast, one of the most beautiful areas in the Mediterranean but completely undeveloped at the time, into an international tourist destination.\"</p>\n\n<p>It took almost 20 years, but ultimately he cobbled together 2,470 acres for the resort from more than 1,000 owners. But that was only half the battle. To get all the permits and authorizations he needed to start building, he eventually had to get more than 3,000 signatures from officials in scores of government agencies.</p>\n\n<p>So far, some $760 million has been spent on Costa Navarino, and the final bill is projected to reach $1.3 billion, according to Achilles. The Greek government has agreed to provide a subsidy of $130 million, half of which has been contributed thus far, he says.</p>\n\n<p>Although the project is only partially completed, it has already created a boom in the region. More than 2,000 workers were hired to build the first two hotels, which now employ 1,200 people directly, according to Achilles. \"As a result, the area is flourishing, with new shops in surrounding towns opening every week, while thousands have closed in the rest of the country because of the economic crisis.\"</p>\n\n<p>Vassilis, a heavy smoker who was diagnosed with cancer in 2005, lived to see only the first part of the resort open. Six weeks before he died, he spoke at a dinner in his honor, and his words could serve as an exhortation to his fellow shipowners. \"Our nation today finds itself at the edge of the abyss,\" he said. \"To debate who is to blame and how we wound up in such a sad state doesn't help our condition. What we must do now is to focus on how we can all join together to save our country, to assist in any way we can our neighbors...and to press our politicians to move forcefully to initiate the reforms that will stimulate growth and prosperity... If that is done, with sacrifices from all of us...our country will achieve a level of admiration worthy of its history and its heritage.\"</p>\n\n<p>Most of the shipowners who were willing to speak about their country's current disastrous circumstances professed their own patriotism, but they are not ready to help steer their country through the financial maelstrom that has engulfed it, they say, because they don't have confidence in the country's leaders. They are instead clinging to a wait-and-see attitude to find out if, in fact, Greece can be rescued by infusions of money and management from the European community and the IMF.</p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a mixture of hope and apprehension among the shipping giants, similar to that expressed by Thanasis Laskaridis: \"Greece has great potential. It is still today one of the world&#146;s best places to live: great scenery, culture, climate, some of the best beaches in the world, and nice, hardworking people. Once we bring our bloated bureaucracy under control and replace most of our current politicians, Greece will boom.\"</p>","article_links":[{"video_link":"","__total_count__":1,"slideshow_link":"/society/photos-of-greek-shipping-industry"}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite - Article 2.0 (Video Article)","publish_date":"2012-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"22920","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Gage","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dsela","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_two_video","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6643783","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/society/photos-of-greek-shipping-industry\">Letter From Athens : Aegean Blues</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/politics/financial-crisis-in-greece\">Aegean Blues</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/money-and-power/john-goodman-scandal\">Too Much Horsepower</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/sexiest-men-2013-photos\">T&amp;C's Top 40 Bachelors</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/money-and-power/mitt-romney-tax-return-debate\">Publish or Perish</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/photos-of-presidential-candidates-financial-disclosures\">Publish or Perish</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/photos-of-famous-equestrians\">Beauties and Their Beasts</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/politics/jill-kelley-and-natalie-khawam-history\">A Four-Star Scandal</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/money-and-power/how-the-wealthy-hide-assets\">What Money?

Grab the bar with an overhand grip, your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and hold it so that the middle of the bar is directly above your chest. Then sit on the end of the bench and press the bar straight over your head. Stop just short of locking your elbows, then slowly lower the bar to your chest.</p>\n\n<h3>Perfect form</h3>\n<p><strong>Your wrists</strong> Keep your wrists directly in line with your forearms. This distributes the weight throughout your arms, reducing strain on your joints.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your head</strong> Keep your head facing forward and your neck in line with your spine at all times. Tilting your head too far backwards or forwards can strain the trapezius and neck muscles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your chest</strong> Lower the bar straight down to the top of your chest. Lowering it too far out in front of you places more stress on you tendons, anterior deltoids and shoulder joints, increasing your risk of injury.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your legs</strong> Sit on a bench with your knees bent and your legs apart to help maintain balance during the lift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your hands</strong> Space them slightly wider than shoulder-width apart in an overhand grip (palms facing forwards). The bar should rest across your palms so that its weight flows straight through your wrists to your elbows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your eyes</strong> Avoid raising your chin to watch the bar as it moves overhead. Stare staight ahead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your arms</strong> Avoid dropping the weight to the start position. Rather, lower it slowly using your arms to offer resistance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your elbows</strong> Keep your elbows pointed down and in line with your chest at the start of the move. Avoid locking them at the top &#150; keep constant tension on your muscles and off your joints.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your lower back</strong> Avoid arching your back and try not to lean.

Not when they are the picture of health, born and bred on clear Montana air, with the sparkle in their eyes to prove it. Not when they balance life as a single mother and speech-language pathologist with running marathons, eating and living organically, and contributing to a small town &#151; where they are loved and supported and live across the street from their parents. Most 26-year-olds with this sort of harmonious life do not face a devastating illness &#151; nor do they need to become insistent on care that turns out to be lifesaving. But this one did.</p>\n<p>In September 2006, Christina Trieweiler was listening to a sermon in church as her 2-year-old daughter, Emma, rested her head against her chest. \"I felt something &#151; a small lump &#151; just below my clavicle,\" she remembers. A few weeks later, during Emma's routine checkup, Christina showed the lump to their family doctor. \"It's probably just a cyst,\" he told her, \"given its location. But watch to see if it grows.\"</p>\n<p>It didn't get bigger, but the lump still nagged at Christina. She was also getting sick more often and feeling more tired than usual, but figured that was normal given her busy life.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year later, while wearing a strapless dress, she caught a glimpse of the lump in an elevator mirror. \"It's not right,\" she said to her boyfriend, Jason Schmidt, a family physician.</p>\n<p>\"If it bothers you, get it checked,\" Jason casually remarked.</p>\n<p>The surgeon Christina saw was equally unconcerned, agreeing that the lump was likely a benign cyst. Still, he offered to remove it if she wanted him to; he warned, however, that she might not be happy with the scar. Christina didn't care about a scar. \"I just want it out,\" she insisted.</p>\n<p>The procedure took only a few minutes, during which the two of them joked about goings-on in their Montana valley. There was no reason for anyone to think the lump might be cancer, but Christina urged the surgeon to send the tissue sample to a pathology lab anyway. \"I'm not sure why,\" she says now. \"Maybe because I'm in the medical field.\" Or maybe it was intuition.</p>\n<p><strong>A SHOCKING REPORT</strong></p>\n<p>That was Wednesday, August 22, 2007. The following Monday, the surgeon called Christina at work. \"I knew it couldn't be good news,\" she says. It turned out the growth wasn't a cyst at all, but an enlarged lymph node, the doctor said. She had cancer: Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>\n<p>\"I was in shock,\" says Christina. She had to get out of the clinic, so she walked out to her car and, shaking, called her dad at his law office in downtown Whitefish. \"I have cancer!\" she cried. Her father, assuring her he'd be right there, left his office immediately, got onto the highway, and met her in the clinic's parking lot, about half an hour away from his office. \"I can't even imagine what that drive was like for him,\" says Christina. In fact, she began to worry about all the people she loved &#151; her parents, her two sisters, and Jason. Although they'd only been dating for six months, the relationship was getting very serious. But most of all, Christina's heart hurt for her daughter. She couldn't bear to think of leaving her little girl.</p>\n<p>And so, for the next week, while her family and Jason operated in high gear, educating themselves about treatment and contacting everyone they knew with medical connections, Christina focused only on Emma. \"I didn't want to miss a moment of the time we had,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Briefly, Christina considered trying alternative treatments, too: helping to fight the cancer through diet changes or by seeing a healer a friend had mentioned. \"But I was so scared; I just didn't have the emotional energy to look thoroughly into alternatives,\" she says. Plus, she just wanted to get rid of the cancer: \"I'd had a scan, and I could see the tumors all the way down my sternum and along my clavicle and neck. And the cancer had been there for at least a year.\"</p>\n<p>Something else happened, too, that put Christina off. She talked to one alternative practitioner about doing a cleanse, but felt the woman was blaming <em>her</em> for having gotten cancer: \"That was the last thing I needed. We have no idea how I got sick. I thought it was terrible to imply it was something I'd done, especially since I was so young and had lived such a healthy life.\"</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>Next: <a href=\"/health/wellness/hodgkins-lymphoma-prognosis\">Choosing a treatment regimen and facing the risks</a></b></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-27T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"955567","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/mR/0312-christina-jason-emma-and-vivian-trieweiler-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Munson","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641945","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/cancer-warning-signs\">The Cancer Her Doctors Missed</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/books-breast-cancer-jan07\">Books for Breast Cancer Patients</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/breast-cancer-1007\">Breast Cancer : New Ways to Beat the Odds</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/family-history-breast-cancer\">\"I'm Too Young to Get Breast Cancer !\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/breast-cancer-surgery-oct07\">Breast Cancer : Know Your Options</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/prevent-skin-cancer\">12 Ways to Protect Your Skin and Prevent Skin Cancer </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/outsmart-breast-cancer\">Outsmart Breast Cancer </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/breast-cancer-research-awareness\">Fight Breast Cancer </a><br>\n<a href=\"/online-sweepstakes/good-housekeepings-nail-breast-cancer-contest-official-rules\">Good Housekeeping's Nail Breast Cancer Contest -

On this late November day, a cold, steady rain has enlarged the potholes into craters that bounce my car as I approach a large, nondescript metal building. It's the kind of obscure facility that's sprinkled across the older suburbs of Michigan, Ohio, and the rest of the car-building belt of the Midwest. GM's Milford Proving Ground is 10 miles to the north, the border of Detroit 25 miles to the south. A small sign outside says PSI SPRINGS. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nInside is the guy everyone says I need to talk to, Steve Bown. He is tall, with wide shoulders and noticeably broad hands that make him look more like a tight end than someone who devotes his waking hours to the minute details of valve springs. He drops me off in the conference room and leaves to fetch his partner, Larry Luchi. And then I spot it on a dusty shelf: a heavy, slightly blackened coil mounted on a small piece of wood. A plaque underneath reads \"Jeff Gordon, 1998 Rockingham Win.\" This tube of steel wire was the first PSI valve spring used in a Nascar race. It revolutionized engine building and the country's most popular motorsport, but few people have ever heard of it.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMy interest in the subject began with a remark by legendary Nascar team owner Jack Roush. This was 15 years ago. I casually asked him if there was a single automotive part with the potential to dramatically alter racing stock cars. Roush isn't in the business of disclosing trade secrets, but he lit up. \"Oh, yeah,\" he said enthusiastically. \"Valve springs. We're getting higher quality valve springs that are going to let us do some tremendous things.\" It was an unexpected answer: These springs are humble engine parts. They simply keep the valves to the combustion chambers closed until the moment that a fresh dose of mixed fuel and air has to enter, or exhaust leave. Roush wouldn't elaborate&#151;maybe he thought he had said too much already. Intrigued, I called other Nascar teams. But racers are as tight with their secrets as the NSA. I got a bunch of \"no comment\" answers and moved on. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nRecently, Nascar's big rules change for 2012&#151;a switch from carburetors to electronic fuel injection&#151;made me wonder whether the innovations Roush hinted at had really changed the sport. I dug back into my contacts among Nascar team owners and engine builders. This time I was able to get people to talk. The highly publicized switch to fuel injection was a sideshow, they told me, in comparison with the changes in engine performance that occurred between 1998 and 2004. During those years, horsepower and engine revolutions had reached once-impossible heights. To understand how, I needed to ask Steve Bown about his valve springs. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nBown and Luchi return to the conference room, where I am contemplating the Jeff Gordon spring. \"We were in the pits during the race,\" Luchi says. \"Keeping our fingers crossed watching the 24 [Gordon's] car.\" It wasn't a particularly exciting race. Videos show Gordon hanging back for most of the contest but clearly dominating the final third of the race. At one point he has a 4-second lead. Gordon had just won the 1997 Nascar championship, and fans had no reason to suspect that anything other than driving skill was at work. But Nascar engineers knew. Inside his engine, 16 newly designed valve springs were ticking away, giving him an advantage. \"By 2001,\" Bown says, \"all the teams were using our springs.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Rules governing Nascar engine architecture</strong></span> date back 50 years. They have evolved, but the basic regulations that limit engine size to 358 cubic inches and define the layout&#151;two valves per cylinder and pushrod valvetrains&#151;were written in 1968. For that reason, Mike Fisher, Nascar's managing director of research and development, has a strange job for someone with his title: keeping a lid on innovation. \"We try to maintain a pretty tight box around what teams can do to the engine,\" he says. \"We don't want one team having more power.\" If the details can seem backward, like running carburetors and burning leaded fuel decades after passenger cars had moved on, there's a certain genius to the strategy. Nascar grandstands are packed partly because, in any given race, there are at least a dozen drivers who could win. In terms of lead changes and tight racing, a Formula 1 race is, by comparison, a procession. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDespite the straitjacket rules, however, Nascar drivers, engineers, and mechanics have always hunted for ways&#151;some legal, others not so much&#151;to get a performance edge. Counterintuitively, massaging the old tech of the Nascar V-8 at the granular level has produced highly advanced engineering. When it came to engine design, though, there was always one weak link. \"The vast majority of engine failures&#151;85 to 90 percent&#151;are caused by broken valve springs,\" says Cecil Stevens, a longtime engine builder who now heads the engineering consulting firm Illusions Engine Development. The reason is simple: Valve springs have an incredibly tough job. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAt each of the engine's eight cylinders, the intake valve lets in fresh air and fuel, and the exhaust valve releases spent gases&#151;16 valves in total. A spring holds a valve closed until the valvetrain system pushes on the top of the spring, forcing the valve to open. Since an engine's output is directly related to the amount of air that flows in and out of the combustion chamber, the valves play a vital role. The larger the valves, and the farther they open, the greater the airflow and the horsepower the engine can produce&#151;and the greater the stress on the spring.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAs much as airflow dictates engine power, so does the speed at which the engine operates. Spin an engine faster and it will, in most cases, make more power. Randy Dorton, the chief engine builder at Hendrick Motorsports, Gordon's team, started a quest in the early '90s to increase engine rpm. Dorton died in a plane crash in 2004, but Jeff Andrews, who is now Hendrick's director of engine operations, has been at the team for about 20 years. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"Back then,\" Andrews says, \"the biggest limiting factor [for higher engine rpm] was the valve springs.\" In 1998, a stock car's V-8 peaked at about 8000 rpm. The valves cycle at half the speed of the engine's crankshaft, so at 8000 rpm the valves open 4000 times per minute, or <i>67 times each second</i>. During many oval races, engines remain at peak rpm for 500 miles&#151;and the valve springs were operating outside their comfort zone. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe springs were a commodity product. Teams bought them from companies whose steady clients were mainstream carmakers. One such company is Peterson Spring, a privately held automotive supplier founded in Detroit in 1914. Dorton approached Peterson about building better valve springs. The company made some improvements, but it simply wasn't focused on racing. While there, Dorton met Peterson engineer Steve Bown and ultimately convinced him that there was a need for a company that focused on racing valve springs. Bown enlisted Larry Luchi, a former Peterson CFO, to handle the business details while he focused on design and manufacturing.

In each stage of life, I've had great friends and great experiences, but when I've moved to the next stage, I've found it difficult to stay connected to those people.</p>\n<p>Keeping these ties strong matters to happiness because, as research shows, a great way to boost happiness in the present is to remember happy times from the past. That's why photographs, scrapbooks, souvenirs, home movies, and other memory prompts are so precious and so worth the effort, despite our time-crunched days.</p>\n<p>In particular, it's valuable to keep relationships strong. Ancient philosophers and contemporary researchers agree: A key to happiness is strong ties to other people. We need intimate, long-term relationships; we need to belong; we need to give and receive support (perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that <em>giving</em> support is just as important to happiness as <em>getting</em> support). Studies suggest that if you have five or more friends with whom to discuss an important matter, you're far more likely to describe yourself as \"very happy.\"</p>\n<p>But the tumult of everyday life &#151; with its whirlwind of everything from carpool, nap schedules, and clogged toilets to graduations, new jobs, and moves to different cities &#151; makes it challenging to maintain those connections over time. And while new friendships that reflect our current circumstances are important, old friends are important, too.</p>\n<p>For instance, no matter how close I feel to my friends here in New York City, I feel a connection to my childhood friends that can never be replaced. We know one another's families; we slept over in one another's basements; we remember the teachers, the birthday parties, the pets, and all those little details from the deep past. As my daughter sang in preschool, \"Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other is gold.\" I feel a similar passion for my college friends. College is such an intense time of life; I feel connected to those people in a unique way.</p>\n<p>But even though I recognize the importance of these relationships, I haven't been good at keeping them strong. To get some ideas about how I might do a better job, I consulted my sister &#151; or, as I call her, \"my sister the sage.\" Although she's five years younger than I am, my sister has always had a powerful influence on me, and I've always admired her outstanding ability to stay close to friends from every stage of her life. I called her in Los Angeles and asked, \"How do you keep up with all your friendships? Do you have any rules for yourself, to make sure you keep those old ties strong?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" she answered thoughtfully, \"one rule that's very helpful is to make some events nonnegotiable &#151; which means, with some events, I'm going no matter what. They're too important to miss. Nothing can keep me from that wedding, or that milestone birthday party, or that reunion.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why is that so helpful?\" I asked.</p>\n<p>\"If I know what's nonnegotiable,\" she told me, \"I don't waste energy or time debating with myself about whether to put it on my calendar and buy the plane ticket. I know I'll go.\"</p>\n<p>That's a valuable idea, especially for someone like me. I usually take weeks to make up my mind, and the mere back-and-forth is exhausting.</p>\n<p>\"Also,\" my sister says, \"I've noticed that when I consider some things nonnegotiable, other people accept it. My husband, the people I work with &#151; they don't argue with me. And when I tell my friends that I consider a certain event nonnegotiable, they're more likely to consider it nonnegotiable, too. And so more friends make the effort, and everyone gets the chance to see everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>I think her rule is very helpful. But as I thought about my own relationships, I realized such opportunities didn't always arise, and sometimes years were going by between times I would see friends face-to-face. In those situations, I've found, technology is very useful. From time to time, I hear someone argue, \"Technology is terrible for relationships. Instead of talking face-to-face, everyone's typing away in front of a screen, alone.\" I disagree. One of my Secrets of Adulthood is \"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" and while chatting on Facebook certainly isn't as satisfying as meeting in person, it's still a valuable way to keep in touch.</p>\n<p>In my experience, tech tools like Facebook and Twitter allow me to manage ties to a much larger group of people than I could possibly stay close to in a more direct way. Technology lets me effortlessly follow friends through many changes of e-mail and street addresses. It allows me to have brief, fun exchanges without expending a lot of time or energy. It gives me a quick way to reach out to friends and also a casual way to connect with people I don't know as well, whom I wouldn't feel comfortable calling or even e-mailing. And I'm not going to send a handwritten letter!</p>\n<p>One example: Recently I had coffee with my friend Jane, whom I hadn't seen in many years. We first met when, for a year after college, I lived in San Francisco with my college roommate, who was dating a guy with a bunch of his own college friends, including Jane. We all spent a lot of time hanging out together.</p>\n<p>I always liked Jane tremendously, but she wasn't one of my closest friends, and I lost track of her years ago. She told me, \"You lose five people with every move\" &#151; true, in the old days! But technology has made staying in touch much easier. Indeed, Jane found me on Facebook, and we discovered that after all this time, we live just 13 blocks apart. Seeing Jane again gave me a wonderful happiness boost by reconnecting me to my past. The year I spent in San Francisco had been wonderful, but I'd almost forgotten it. Talking to Jane brought back a flood of memories and affection.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, when I'm trying to decide how to spend my limited time, energy, and money, I often ask myself, <em>Will this strengthen my relationships? Will this connect me to my past?</em> I'm now far more likely to show up at parties, to send a quick \"This made me think of you\" note through cyberspace &#151; or even just to revisit places in which I used to spend a lot of time.</p>\n<p>A while back, I went to Washington, DC, to give a talk to my law school association. This trip made me happy for many reasons. I saw some of my blog-land pals from that area. I cruised around Washington, which is a beautiful city, especially when everything is blooming. Most of all, I loved being around a bunch of people from my law school. It was funny &#151; I hadn't realized just how many references, interests, and inside jokes we shared. Sometimes it makes me sad that I've left behind my lawyerly identity &#151; there were many things I enjoyed about that time. Staying connected to that part of my past makes me happy.</p>\n<br /><p><b>Have you found that reconnecting to your past boosts your happiness? How do you keep those relation-ships active and vital?

Instead, they're answering the challenge with side hustles--many of which can be done from home or on a flexible schedule. Why is the extra work worth it? The thousands in added income can make the down payment on a house possible, erase credit card debt, provide little luxuries, and, perhaps most importantly, give you back a sense of financial control.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In the words of Hannah*, 30, a single mom of a 5-year-old who added a few waitressing shifts to her full-time job as a school psychologist: \"I'm doing what I have to do to keep a roof over my son's head. It almost feels noble.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>She's right: There is something heroic about swooping in with a talent or a former job skill you've been harboring all these years and turning it into real money. So how can you help your family's bottom line? Ask these smart, fierce supermoms who have found real-life ways to make more money, <em>their</em> way, on <em>their </em>time. They definitely deserve capes, and so will you.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>PET BOARDING </strong></h3>\n<p>If you love dogs, pet boarding can be an easy way to earn anywhere from $20 to $50 a night, per pooch, depending on where you live (rates tend to be higher in cities). Lindamarie Schweizer, 59, regularly boards dogs in her Scottsdale, AZ, home where she lives with her husband and two teenagers.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>How to get started:</strong> Lindamarie joined <a href=\"http://www.sleepoverrover.com/\" target=\"_new\">sleepoverrover.com</a>, a site that handles all of her advertising, reservations, and payments. (Another option: Partner with a local vet or pet store and ask them to refer people to you.)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>VIRTUAL ASSISTING</strong></h3>\n<p>Earn $45 to $50 a day executing other people's random tasks. The site <a href=\"http://www.taskrabbit.com/\" target=\"_new\">taskrabbit.com</a>, for example, has a long list of \"virtual assistance\" gigs you can do via your laptop, ranging from data entry to online research. The best part: You can work from anywhere. Zarah Pimentel, 43, runs a virtual-assistant business from her home in the Philippines and says it helps her make extra money now that her 6-year-old daughter is in school. \"I can work in my pajamas without makeup, and I never have to sit in traffic,\" says Zarah, who earns $6 an hour because she's overseas (assistants in the United States can earn more than triple that rate). \"The more technical your skills, the more you can charge,\" she adds.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>How to get started: </strong>To sign up with <a href=\"http://www.taskrabbit.com/\" target=\"_new\">taskrabbit.com</a>, go to the site to submit an online application and do a video interview. In return, the company will send you a copy of its guidelines and quiz you on it. The process usually takes about a week to get through, and 70 percent of applicants are accepted. Similar sites worth looking into are <a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\" target=\"_new\">elance.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.odesk.com/\" target=\"_new\">odesk.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.virtualassistants.com/\" target=\"_new\">virtualassistants.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-22T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"950324","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/y4/rbk-easy-money-0312-1-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Torabi","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641411","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/money-career/tips-advice/live-your-dream/make-easy-money\">Make Easy Money !

Position your lower legs under the ankle pads so the undersides of the pads touch your calves just above your ankles. Without moving your upper body, curl your lower legs until the ankle pads are almost touching your gluteus maximus (bum muscles). At the top of the move, contract your glutes for two seconds, then lower your legs until they're almost straight.</p>\n\n<h3>Perfect form</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Your head</strong> Position your head face-down on the pad. Turning it to the side or tilting it up will strain your neck muscles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your lower back</strong> Your spine should stay straight throughout the exercise. Arching backwards only takes the emphasis off your hamstrings and puts unnecessary stress on your lower back.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your hips</strong> Keep your hips flat on the bench. Lifting them takes tension off your hamstrings and places it on your lower back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your chest</strong> Keep your chest flat on the bench. If you feel it rising, you're probably using too much weight and/or arching your back to help pull your feet towards your buttocks.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your backside</strong> Contract your glutes at the top of the move (when your heels are close to your bum).</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your hands</strong> Grab the handles (or the front of the bench), but resist the urge to use your grip to pull yourself forward as you curl.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your hamstrings</strong> To build them, keep your thighs together and flat on the bench. Twisting, rotating or lifting your thighs off the bench cheats your hamstrings by using momentum and other muscles to pull the weight up.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your ankles</strong> Adjust the pads so that the backs of your ankles can tuck in underneath them. If the pads rest on your heels, your feet could slip out as you curl the weight up. having them too high on your claves changes the arc of the exercise and robs your hamstrings of work.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your feet</strong> Don't point your feet outwards or inwards, because that can shift some of the effort on to the abductor (outer-thigh) or abductor (inner-thigh) muscles. This can also disrupt your knee alignment, leading to injury.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Your knees</strong> Your knees should hang just over the edge of the bench. Resting them on the bench makes it easier to hyperextend and strain them as you curl.</p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite (UK)","publish_date":"2012-02-21T07:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21141","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"hn-mttvo","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641611","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/blogs/perfect-form-the-lying-leg-curl\">Perfect your form : the lying leg curl </a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/how-to-do-the-perfect-press-up\">Get more from&hellip;

Leaf through a few glossy magazines and light upon an appealing consumer durable that is affordable &#150; but only just. Put the magazine aside for a few days while you stoke up your desire for said gizmo, gadget, gewgaw or G-string, then pick it up again and goggle some more. Next, research your object of desire on the web. Check out its availability, its price, the full range of colours, textures and perhaps even odours that it&#146;s available in &#150; then consider the deluxe version.</p>\n\n<p>Again, take a few days&#146; downtime before venturing out into the actual retail zone itself. The internet is a dreadful innovation when it comes to shopping. To say that it fosters the impulse to buy is an understatement on par with suggesting that Paris is a city. Plainly, internet shopping is <em>waaay</em> too fast. <font style=\"background-color: yellow\">If people could shop for smack and sex on the web with guaranteed next-day delivery, everyone in Britain with a credit card that wasn&#146;t already maxed-out would become a fornicating junky</font>.</p>\n\n<p>No, proper shopping demands a leisurely approach. One should enter the emporium that stocks the-thing-you-think-you-love after eyeing it up in the window for at least 20 minutes. You might want to take a few male friends with you; perhaps arrange to visit a department store or shopping centre that has a good restaurant and make a day of it. Before the actual viewing of the item you can have a spot of lunch and discuss mutual friends. (Men often wonder what it&#146;s like to be a woman. But sod the five-minute orgasms, this experience should address all your most profound curiosity.) When you finally arrive at The Thing, with your friends in tow you can spend a further, oh, hour or so trying it on, or fiddling with it, or trying it out, before asking them if it looks big in your bum, or whatever it is women want to know. Then, of course, there will be another hour or so making a real human connection with the salesperson, and asking all sorts of questions. And not just about The Thing, but also about his holidays, his commute, his pension...</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when you&#146;ve exhausted all possible approaches to the actual act of purchase, here&#146;s the clincher: don&#146;t buy it. That&#146;s right, don&#146;t buy it after all. Say to the salesperson, &#147;Thank you very much, but I think I&#146;m going to think about this a bit more.&#148; Then leave the shop and as you walk down the road you will feel &#150; and this I absolutely guarantee &#150; fantastic! Remember, you could only just afford said purchase and now, having not bought it, you&#146;re substantially in the black. Moreover, you&#146;ve had all the anticipation of ownership with none of the disillusionment that invariably follows an outlay that&#146;s marginal in terms of your personal economy. Let me tell you, I&#146;ve been practising this kind of slow shopping &#150; as I term it &#150; for years now, and it&#146;s made me happy, wealthy and so envied by my cash- strapped friends that when I ask them to go with me they ejaculate a torrent of abuse.</p>\n\n<p>But then that&#146;s men for you, isn&#146;t it?</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p><font size=\"1\"><em>Words: Will Self<br />Photography:

Make it fun by downloading the Packing Pro app ($2.99) to your tablet or smartphone and letting the kids borrow it.

Anything silk, linen, or wrinkle-prone goes on the bottom. When you're done, place a small flat bag filled with underwear and socks on top of your duds. Then wrap each piece of clothing around the bag to form one compact, amazingly wrinkle-resistant bundle.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>3.&#160;Prep for security.</strong></p>\n<p>Set out comfy clothes and shoes for the plane so the next morning runs smoother. And don't stress if your kids want to wear their lace-ups: Children 12 and under can now leave shoes on, thanks to new TSA rules. Also, go ahead and stash iPods, Game Boys, and cameras in your carry-ons; only laptops need to come out at security.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-21T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"949536","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/wf/rbk-packing-for-vacation-0312-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Niedringhaus","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"vdenny","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641436","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

gym exercises to make you a better runner</h1>\n\n<br /><h3>Olympic Gold medallist Iwan Thomas shows you the resistance moves <br />to help you go further and faster on your next run</h3>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/iwan-thomas.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<br /><h2>1. Dumb-bell bent-over rows</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How to do it</strong> Stand with your legs apart and slightly flexed, your body bent at waist so it's almost perpendicular to the ground. Hold a dumb-bell in each hand with your arms hanging down. Row the dumb-bells in towards your shoulders, then return to the start position. \"Make sure you keep your core tight throughout the move.\" says Thomas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sets and reps</strong> 3x12</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why</strong> It's a great workout for your shoulders, arms and lower back. \"This will improve the strength in your arms which, in turn, will improve your speed,\" explains Thomas. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Dumb-bell bent-arm pullovers</h2>\n\n <p><strong>How to do it</strong> Lie on your back on a bench. Hold one end of a dumb-bell with two hands straight above you, then lower the weight behind your head. Bring it back up to the starting position and repeat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sets and reps</strong> 3x12</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why</strong> \"This move targets your triceps,\" says Thomas. Effectively working the biggest muscles in your arms ensures you'll fill your shirt sleeves and can drive your body forward faster.</p>\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n<h2>3. Dumb-bell lateral raise</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How to do it</strong> Stand or sit with a dumb-bell in each hand hanging at the side of your body. Lift your arms out to the side until your arms are fully extended and your hands are at shoulder height, so your body forms a capital 'T' shape.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sets and reps</strong> 3x12</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why</strong> \"Again, this is a great upper-body move, engaging a number of the larger muscle groups,\" says Thomas. \"To increase speed, it's crucial to strengthen your upper body.</p>\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n<h2>4. Box step with knee drive</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How to do it</strong> Stand behind a box with a dumb-bell in each hand. Place your left foot on top of the box, your heel aligned with the closest edge. Step up onto the box in a quick explosive movement, driving your right knee up towards your chest. Repeat with your other leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sets and reps</strong> 3x20 each side</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why</strong> \"This is a great exercise for working your glutes, which are important for balance and technique,\" says Thomas.</p>\n\n \n<h2>5. V-ups</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How to do it</strong> Lie on your back on the floor or a bench with your knees bent and hands extended towards the ceiling. Your head should be in a neutral position with a space between your chin and chest. Leading with your chin and chest, contract your abs and raise your shoulders off the floor or bench. Simultaneously, raise your legs up towards the ceiling and attempt to touch your hands to your feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sets and reps</strong> 3x20</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why</strong> Core strength is an essential asset for a strong, fast runner.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/iwan-thomas2.jpg\" /><br />\n\n\n<p><font size=\"1\"><em>Iwan Thomas

Approaching your employer</h2>\n<p>First, you need to get your employer to agree to the break. This isn&#146;t your standard holiday request form &#150; so approach carefully.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Southgate from the <a href=\"http://www.theschooloflife.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>School of Life</strong></a> says the main problem in securing a long period of leave is that \"people don't know how to put the case forward and are unsure how to ask the question\". Plan the conversation and approach your employer with a concise and organised view as to why you should be allowed the break.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Make your case</h2>\n<p>Remember that your boss is most likely to say no if your departure will leave them with a big hole in the organisation. Make sure your employer knows the benefits of the sabbatical to them as well as you. And suggest suitable cover in your absence. </p>\n\n<p>\"People tend to underestimate how much employers don't want to lose valued employees, so your position is often stronger than you think,\" says Southgate. Offer to leave at a quiet time, and make a hand-over plan. Owed a promotion or payrise? Southgate says this is your bargaining chip to getting a straight month off and making your indispensability work for you.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Managing the break</h2>\n<p>If your employer agrees to a sabbatical, it will most likely be unpaid. \"But time away can be far cheaper than you think,\" says Dan Clements, author of <em>Escape 101: The Four Secrets to Taking a Sabbatical or Career Break Without Losing Your Money or Your Mind</em>. </p>\n\n<p>\"The biggest secret to funding your time away is simply putting money aside. Open a separate bank account. Have a regular amount deposited there weekly or monthly. And look into renting your house out for the month.\"</p>\n\n<h2>4. Get connected</h2>\n<p>\"Unless you have a very specific reason to stay put, make sure you get a change of scenery,\" says Clements. \"Your 'normal' life will consume a month off and leave you with nothing to show for it.\nYou hear stories of people house-sitting in the tropics, or delivering yachts, or working with dolphins in paradise. They're compelling tales, but they almost all share a similar root: they were found by networking. Just like great jobs, great career breaks are about connecting with others.\"</p>\n\n<h2>5. Get zen</h2>\n<p>\"Make sure you plan your month off as much as possible,\" says Southgate. \"It's a rare treat and you want to be able to make the most of it.\" In doing so you&#146;ll come away with a much better outlook, and perhaps an idea on some vital changes to make in your life. The School of Life considers any break 'time on' rather than 'time off' &#150; harness this mindset for a successful month.</p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\"><br />Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n\n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-02-16T07:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6632498","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/living/negotiate-a-month-off-work\">How to negotiate a month off work</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex/How-to-negotiate-a-one-night-stand\">How to negotiate a one night stand</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/dodge-the-bullet\">Dodge the bullet</a><br>\n<a href=\"/lose-weight/healthiest-international-cuisine\">The healthiest international cuisine</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/money/stag-night-spending-44534\">Stag night spending</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/5-tips-for-saving-on-gym-membership-420329\">5 tips for saving on gym membership</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/talk-yourself-into-a-pay-rise\">Talk yourself into a pay rise</a><br>\n<a href=\"/style/office-wardrobe-dress-for-business\">Dress for career success</a><br>\n<a href=\"/lose-weight/fast-track-your-fat-burning\">Fast track your fat burning</a><br>\n<a href=\"/style/shave-some-time-off-157440\">Shave some time off </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"Nov '11","print_issue_date":"2012-01-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:31:37.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-01-04T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/living/travel/negotiate-a-month-off-work","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"How to handle those tricky critter situations","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"dog groomer, bad dog haircut, dog park, loud bark, bully dog","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"5 Pet Problems, Solved","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-19T14:45:11.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/etiquette/peggy-post-dog-barking-may07","link_text":"Does Your Neighbor's Dog Bark Too Much?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-behavior","link_text":"Decoding Your Dog's Behavior"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-training-destructive-behavior","link_text":"Stop Your Dog's Destructive Behavior"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-training-stop-scratching","link_text":"Stop Your Dog from Shredding the Curtains"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-breed-quiz","link_text":"Which Dog is Right for You?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-cat-depression","link_text":"Is Your Dog or Cat Depressed?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/peggy-post-dog-leash-may07","link_text":"Should that Dog Be on a Leash?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/dog-training-barking-at-phone","link_text":"Why Your Dog Barks When You're on the Phone"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/holidays/pimp-dog-costumes","link_text":"Pimp Dog Costumes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/pet-advice/largest-dog-breeds","link_text":"Dog Breeds: Giant"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Nina","source_id":"10","teaser":"The ever-barking dog next door.

Given America's enormous pet population of 86 million cats and 78 million dogs, the answer seems to be \"Not many of us.\" But when animals and people mix, dicey social situations sometimes result. Here, some common ones &#151; and the expert solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>When my 7-year-old's friend comes over, he's too rough with our family cat. Saying \"Be gentle!\" hasn't helped. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>It's possible that this kid hasn't had much exposure to animals and doesn't understand what \"gentle\" means with regard to your cat, so try making it a teachable moment, advises Gail Melson, Ph.D., professor emerita of developmental studies at Purdue University and author of <em>Why the Wild Things Are: Animals in the</em> Lives of Children.</em> You can demonstrate, saying, \"This is how Fluffy likes to be petted. Now she's purring!\" But if the child is still too rough, put Fluffy in another room &#151; no point in traumatizing your pet. Post-playdate, speak to the child's parent &#151; but don't do it at the door. \"Pickup time is often a rushed moment, so don't raise the issue then, especially not in front of the kids,\" says Melson. \"Say, 'John's glad Matthew could come over. I want to talk to you about something &#151; can I give you a ring tonight?' \" Later, on the phone, stick to what you observed, without passing judgment: \"I just wanted to let you know that the last few times Matthew has been over, he's tried to poke our cat with a pencil and pull her tail. I'm worried the cat might scratch or bite him if he keeps it up.\" Then, trust your instincts about future get-togethers; if the parent promises to intervene and help the child be more gentle, fine; if he is still too rough and you feel as if you're in a scene from <em>Criminal Minds,</em> drop him from the social calendar and help your child develop new relationships. If your son asks why the boy doesn't visit anymore, Melson suggests saying something like, \"Matthew can't come to play because he's too rough with Fluffy, and Fluffy needs to be safe.\"</p>\n<p><strong>My dog got the worst haircut at the usual groomer's. I was so shocked, I just paid and left. What else could I have done?</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever there's a problem at the groomer's, don't pay without speaking with the manager. \"That's the person who wants you to be happy and return to the salon,\" says Heidi Ganahl, CEO of Camp Bow Wow, a national pet services company. Be specific without being critical &#151; not \"You ruined my dog!\" but \"I wanted Brady's muzzle an inch long and his ears rounded. That's the way he's always been groomed here.\" Then let the manager suggest a solution, and keep negotiating. If you're told they'll groom your dog for free next time, you can say, \"Thanks, but I need him looking his best by this weekend. Can someone else even his coat out now?\"</p>\n<p>In your case, though you've already left the scene of the crime, you still have recourse, says Ganahl. Call the manager and say, \"I didn't realize it at pickup, but my dog's haircut isn't what I wanted, and I'm awfully disappointed.\" Don't hang up until you come to an agreement. If you don't feel satisfied with the salon's best offer, it's probably time to switch groomers. And wherever you wind up, take an extra minute to speak directly to the stylist. Precise direction &#151; how long you want the coat, what shape you want the ears and tail &#151; will help prevent bad hair days.</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>Next: <a href=\"/family/pet-advice/pet-problem-solutions-2\">Dog bullying, pet-sitting trust issues, and nonstop barking</a></b></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-16T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"943932","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/q8/mischievous-dog-cat-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Malkin","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641929","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/etiquette/peggy-post-dog-barking-may07\">Does Your Neighbor's Dog Bark Too Much?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-behavior\">Decoding Your Dog's Behavior</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-training-destructive-behavior\">Stop Your Dog's Destructive Behavior</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-training-stop-scratching\">Stop Your Dog from Shredding the Curtains</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-breed-quiz\">Which Dog is Right for You?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-cat-depression\">Is Your Dog or Cat Depressed?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/peggy-post-dog-leash-may07\">Should that Dog Be on a Leash?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-training-barking-at-phone\">Why Your Dog Barks When You're on the Phone</a><br>\n<a href=\"/holidays/pimp-dog-costumes\">Pimp Dog Costumes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/pet-advice/largest-dog-breeds\">Dog Breeds: Giant</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:32:13.000Z","author_id":"8626","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/pet-advice/pet-problem-solutions","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"<i>Seventeen</i>'s Flirty Girl Panel tells you how to get your crush to notice you!","site_id":"1","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.seventeen.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"kacciardo","keywords":"advice, boyfriend, dating tips, date, hookup, kiss, relationship, makeout, guys, dating advice, texting, facebook flirting, flirting tips, flirting, flirty girl panel","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"The Best Flirting Tricks!","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-01-03T19:01:16.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love/best-flirting-tips","link_text":"35 of Our Best Flirting Tips !"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love/advice/beach-flirting-tips","link_text":"5 Flirting Moves Not to Do"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love/advice/flirting-tips","link_text":"Flirting Tips !"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love/advice/girl-flirting-gt-070607","link_text":"What&rsquo;s a telltale sign a girl is flirting with you?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love/flirty-girl-tips","link_text":"The Best Flirting Tips !"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/video/online-flirting---dating-tips---seventeen-seconds-video-5028678001","link_text":"Online Flirting -

But most nights I forget to do it.</p>\n<p>Bacteria between your teeth can obviously infect the gums and cause bone and even tooth loss. But that's not the worst of it: It's possible that inflammation from gum disease may also lead to heart disease, strokes, and pneumonia. It might even hurt your chances of getting pregnant: In research presented to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, women with gum disease took two months longer to conceive compared to women with healthy mouths. Try using floss picks, which are easier to maneuver for floss-haters than the traditional string.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>CONFESSION: </strong> I'm a three-cups-a-day coffee drinker. And we're not talking decaf.</p>\n<p>The never-ending good news about java could ease your worries, if not your jitters. Research suggests that drinking coffee may help protect against Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Plus, women who drink two to three cups of coffee a day &#151; that's 10 to 15 ounces &#151; have a 15 percent lower risk of depression than nondrinkers, a new study from the Harvard School of Public Health found. \"A major symptom of depression is losing interest in doing things you love. And caffeine gives you a great boost of energy,\" explains study author Michel Lucas, Ph.D.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>CONFESSION:</strong>&#160;I never wipe down my cell phone. It must be crawling with germs.</p>\n<p>Yeah, it is. A new study found that one in six cell phones are contaminated with fecal bacteria like E. coli. How does&#160;<em>that&#160;</em>happen? Not washing up after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper. Ingesting E. coli can cause vomiting and/or diarrhea. And letting someone with a cold or flu use your cell is an easy way to transfer microbes and get yourself sick too. So clean your phone with a disinfecting wipe weekly, says microbiologist Charles Gerba, Ph.D. Oh, and please wash your hands.</p>\n<div>&#160;</div>\n<p><strong>CONFESSION:</strong> I skipped my last gyno appointment.</p>\n<p>A pelvic exam isn't our idea of a good time either. But the key to good health is regular visits to your doc, rather than getting care when a problem arises, says John Fisch, M.D., an ob/gyn at Magee Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh. Even if you've gotten your gyno's okay to stretch Pap smears to once every three years, you still need to be checked annually for other sexual-health issues like breast cancer and period problems.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>CONFESSION: </strong>I haven't seen the inside of a gym in years!</p>\n<p>If your goal is health, fitness <em>needs</em> to be a part of your life. But as long as you're getting your exercise somehow, it doesn't matter whether you're doing it in a gym or prefer to sweat in solitude, like in your backyard or in front of the TV. If you're the kind of gal who gets tons of exercise in her daily life &#151; say, chasing your dog around all the time, or biking to work &#151; that absolutely counts. \"But not exercising at all accelerates aging in every part of your body &#151; your insides as much as your outsides,\" says health and wellness expert Jillian Michaels. \"To get yourself moving, recruit a friend to work out with you, which builds a support system and holds you accountable when you'd rather park your butt on the couch.\" And start by telling yourself you'll move for just 15 minutes a day: One recent study found that's all it took to increase life span by three years.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-15T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"944541","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/Ji/cellphone-sm.jpeg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Girdwain","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641418","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/bad-health-habits\">Fix Your Worst Health Habits --Fast</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/breaking-bad-habits\">How 5 Moms Kicked Their Worst Health Habits (and You Can, Too)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty-fashion/tips-advice/how-to/break-bad-beauty-habits\">5 Tricks to Break Your Bad Beauty Habits </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/hottest-health-trends\">10 Hottest Health Trends</a><br>\n<a href=\"/money-career/tips-advice/live-your-dream/pay-off-debt\">How to Kick Your Credit Habit</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/health-habits-you-can-skip\">3 Health Habits that Are Good Enough</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/fix-bad-marriage-habits\">Break Your Bad Relationship Habits </a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/get-organized-school-year\">School Ideas: 10 Time-Saving Habits </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty-fashion/bad-skin-habits\">7 Bad Habits that Hurt Your Skin</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/common-health-myths\">5 Health Habits It's Okay to Skip</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"headline_image_id":"944540","print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:14:17.000Z","author_id":"11241","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/health-wellness/advice/unhealthy-habits","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"We asked a bunch of happily married coupled people to tell us how they stay close.

Our brains work in the same wonky way, which is why he understands me like nobody else does. That doesn't mean we always get along; there have been times when I thought the mere sight of him would land me on CNN, being escorted away in handcuffs. But our moments of spookily accurate couple ESP remind me that what we have is special. You share each other with the world, but knowing that there's something you only do with &#151; or get about &#151; one another is what makes you feel so wholly lucky to be together.

If my wife, Karel, finds out, she'll throw a fit (she's urged me to stop bringing home stuff I've found in the garbage), so I'm hiding it in our basement in hopes that the smell will go away. What does this have to do with anything? Well, most guys have stuff they don't want to share with their wives, or the rest of the world--things that make us feel guilty or strange. But no more. REDBOOK is all about confessions this month, so with this column, I am WikiLeaking the dark corners of my mind in an effort to have a more open, positive relationship. I hereby announce that I'm sowing the seeds for my \"Aaron Spring.\" And I'm betting my list will illuminate the opaque spots of your man's secret self too. Let the catharsis begin!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>1. I play dead to get out of stuff. </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>From faking illness and injury to get out of a niece's first Communion or a dinner with the in-laws, to silently \"hanging out\" in the attic when their wives want them to clean the gutters, most guys play possum at some point in their relationships, because a lot of the things you want us to do are about as fun as... cleaning gutters. For me, it's when the kids cry out in the middle of the night. I'm at my worst between my \"goodnight glass of scotch\" and the first sounds of my children fighting in the morning. I'm bleary, incoherent, and off-balance. (Perhaps my goodnight glass of scotch should be a little smaller.) I always end up making my kids feel worse when I show up in their room bumping into things and cursing, so I fake sleeping through their cries and let Karel grumpily deal with it. I make sure that on those nights, Karel gets to sleep in the next morning, but somehow I think that might not make up for it.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>2. I behaved irresponsibly right up until saying \"I do.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Guys hold on to bachelorhood like Kate Winslet held on to Leonardo DiCaprio in <em>Titanic. </em>We're not letting go until it becomes clear that we'll be dragged under the icy North Atlantic if we cling to it any longer. The most obvious example of this is the bachelor party. Years ago, when I worked security at bars, I was always amazed that dudes thought it was okay to have one final go with a stripper a week before tying the knot. I never had a bachelor party (after trying to control them as a bouncer, they lost their appeal for me), but I did do my share of drugs right up until the last possible minute. Karel made it clear that my partying was a deal breaker in our relationship, so I secretly eked out every Keith Richards moment I could until we exchanged rings. I know it sounds childish, but before I got married, I firmly believed that the transition from boyfriend to husband would be as dramatic as night and day, and that I would wake up a different man. Believe it or not, I did.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>3. I miss casual sex.</strong></p>\n<p>I love being married, and I appreciate monogamy. It keeps me focused in a way I never was while I was on the prowl, and I'm also lucky that my wife happens to be a firecracker. However, I also used to love wandering into a bar and walking out with a stranger, someone I could spend a few fun hours with, no strings attached. It's a huge ego boost, especially when you don't look like Tom Brady. It makes you feel like the greatest used-car salesman in the world. It's also kinda romantic. Not Disney romantic--more like Nina Simone romantic: melancholy, boozy, lovely, very adult, and weirdly French. Who doesn't want to feel a little French every now and then?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-14T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"944556","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/1O/man-vault-0312-1-smn.jpeg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Traister","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641444","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

day I flew home after Dad died, I found Mom in a state of confusion. Her dementia had not yet progressed to the point where she needed care in a facility, but when the family brought in full-time caregivers to help with Dad, we all realized Mom couldn't be left alone in the house, either. I stayed in her room that night, bunking awkwardly on Dad's hospital-style bed, hoping Mom would feel less alone. Sitting with me before she turned in, she tried to grasp the implications of Dad's death. \"What will I do?\" she said.</p>\n<p>It was the beginning of a long road that started with new round-the-clock hired caregivers. Over the next eight years, as her cognitive abilities declined, Mom moved in with my sister and her family until the strain on the household became too great. She then went to an assisted living unit and eventually entered the nursing home where she lives today.</p>\n<p>My siblings who lived near her took primary responsibility for everything&#151;from her immediate care to selling the house&#151;while I mainly watched guiltily from a 1,000-mile distance. But sitting with her that night, trying to be reassuring and focused on the now, I had no idea what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>\"There's a continuum of ways people become caregivers. Often a loved one suffers a stroke, accident or fall or a chronic condition worsens, and people are thrust into a situation. But few plan for it as well as they could,\" says Leah Eskenazi, director of operations and planning for the Family Caregiver Alliance: National Center on Caregiving.</p>\n<p>As Americans become older and live longer, more and more of us are suddenly finding ourselves in this situation. The number of adults helping a parent personally or financially has tripled in the past 15 years, according to a recent study by MetLife, the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and New York Medical College. Most caregivers (66%) are women in their late 40s caring for a mother or other female relative, but some 14% help another adult age 49 or younger. All told, an estimated 36 million U.S. households have at least one person who's a caregiver, and 3 in 10 of them have been doing it for more than five years.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, the demands take a physical and emotional toll, and caregivers are more likely to say their health is fair or poor. Yet caregiving does have its rewards. \"It can actually improve relationships with parents, create positive memories and foster peace of mind,\" says Eskenazi. \"The challenge is to maintain balance and not lose track of your own needs.\" To help you do that, read on to learn how to navigate the common caregiving milestones so you'll be prepared for what might happen before it does.</p>\n<h3><em>\"Is everything OK?\"</em></h3>\n<p>Adult children often don't realize aging parents need care until a family get-together. \"I call it the holiday eye-opener,\" says Larry Minnix, president and CEO of LeadingAge, an advocacy organization for aging adults and their caregivers (formerly the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging). \"It's often when the family's together in one place that everyone realizes Dad isn't remembering things or Mom's house has become unusually unkempt.\" Trouble signs: food spoiling in the refrigerator, always finding parents dressed in the same clothes, stacks of papers or mail, left-on appliances like a stove, and an unusually messy house or yard&#151;which can suggest problems handling everyday tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Talk with your parents about medical and financial issues</strong>. A good first step is to ask them for a list of all the medications they're taking and their doctors' contact info. Then you can segue into the tougher questions such as living wills and healthcare proxies. \"I finally said to my parents, 'If something happens, I have no information to go on to carry out your preferences, so I would like us all to sit down and talk,'\" says Eskenazi, a social worker by training.</p>\n<p>Other crucial questions include where they keep important papers and whether they have a safe deposit box. They should also sign release forms allowing doctors to share private medical information with you. And your family needs to work out who should have power of attorney if your parents are unable to make competent decisions for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask the doctors to give an overview</strong>. If your family member is diagnosed with a condition, find out their prognosis and what's involved. Many diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancer can follow a predictable arc, but even if they don't, understanding the likely progress of the disease helps you plan ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate whether they can stay in their home</strong>. \"The vast majority of people want to age where they've always lived,\" says Gail Gibson Hunt, CEO of the National Alliance for Caregiving. Basic safety measures can go a long way toward making that possible:<br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Install grab bars in bathrooms and showers, and put raised seats on toilets. <br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Turn down the water heater temperature to avoid scalding. <br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Get rid of tripping hazards such as throw rugs and power cords. <br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Put brighter bulbs into lamps, especially in walkways.<br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Place no-slip adhesive strips on steps and slippery surfaces such as bath tile and shower floors.<br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#183; Suggest a wearable alarm with a button to call for assistance.</p>\n<p>For guidance on assessing what help your loved one needs, go to<a href=\"http://caregiverslibrary.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> CaregiversLibrary.org</a> for a needs assessment worksheet and in-home care options.</p>\n<p><strong>Be realistic about your ability to help out</strong>. For example, if a parent needs to be lifted and you have a bad back or can't be with him all day, you may need to hire help. To find an agency that provides skilled workers, go to the National Association for Home Care & Hospice at <a href=\"http://nahc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">nahc.org</a>, and type your city and state into their Agency Locator. (Agencies screen and often train caregivers who may be covered by Medicaid or long-term care insurance.)</p>\n<p>You can also privately hire a caregiver, which can be less expensive, since you eliminate agency fees (but you may have to pay their employment taxes; check with your accountant). Networks of friends, neighbors and religious or community organizations like the local senior center, YMCA or Jewish Community Center (JCC) are good sources to help you find reliable, skilled caregivers. Your local Area Agency on Aging can give you an idea of going rates.</p>\n<h3><em>\"Why don't you move in?\"</em></h3>\n<p>Having the person you're caring for move in can work fabulously. But think carefully about taking someone far from her community. \"Knowing friends, neighbors and people in the area can be important,\" Eskenazi says. \"Someone with no network becomes totally dependent on you for physical demands<em> and </em>for all the social and emotional aspects of his well-being.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Figure out how well your loved one can function day-to-day</strong>.<strong> </strong>A healthcare professional can assess her based on nationally recognized criteria known as IADLs&#151;instrumental activities of daily living. (Ask if your insurance pays for an evaluation.) Documenting how much assistance she needs to bathe, dress, eat, walk, use the toilet and handle activities like shopping, laundry or taking medication can help gauge whether or not you can take care of your loved one in your home and her eligibility for services. For example, someone who qualifies for nursing home care may be able to get services that help him stay in his own home from a program called PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), available through Medicare and Medicaid in some states.</p>\n<p>For an overview of resources in your area, click on your state on the Family Caregiver Alliance's Family Care Navigator at <a href=\"http://caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/home.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">Caregiver.org</a>. The site also answers common questions such as how to get help when you need a break or how to take time off work to care for a loved one.</p>\n<p><strong>Map out the physical and emotional factors</strong>. Questions to consider: Where will your loved one sleep? Can you set up her own living space so she'll have some privacy or independence? Given your past relationship, can you get along? Can you both accept that you're the boss? Are you comfortable handling personal care like bathing or changing an adult diaper?</p>\n<p>Include the care receiver in the conversation as much as you can. Does she really want to live with you? And be sure to gauge the impact on your family. \"If a teen is asked to give up a room so Grandma can stay, there may be issues to address before she moves in,\" Eskenazi says.</p>\n<p><strong>Come to an agreement about who pays what</strong>. Go over questions such as: Will a parent help pay living expenses? Will siblings pitch in? Which costs are shared and which ones will you pay out of pocket? Also work with your other family members to create a schedule that allows for periodic breaks, and figure out who will care for your loved one when you go on vacation or have to deal with an emergency.</p>\n<h3><em>\"We need to consider a home.\"</em></h3>\n<p>Not everyone can accommodate a live-in loved one. And many who do it initially find that it becomes too overwhelming. \"There's a realization that this is beyond what you signed on for,\" says Hunt. A caregiver who's persistently depressed (unable to get out of bed, feeling hopeless and sad on most days) is one sign that it's time to find a new arrangement. Other indications: \"The ailing person no longer recognizing you or becoming incontinent are often tipping points,\" says Eskenazi. Before starting your search, you, your loved one and family members involved should sit down with a financial advisor to discuss what funds you have and how long they'll last.</p>\n<p><strong>Check the Eldercare Locator</strong> from the U.S. Administration on Aging (<a href=\"http://eldercare.gov/Eldercare.NET/Public/Index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Eldercare.gov</a>; 800-677-1116). Searching by the type of service you need and your zip code will provide a list of agencies (such as your local Area Agency on Aging) that can help you find and evaluate local facilities. If the person you're caring for is on the younger side, try starting with the local United Way, which can help sort through services available in their community. A quick guide:</p>\n<p><em>Continuing care retirement communities</em><strong> </strong>work like insurance policies: Residents buy in when they're healthy, often make a large payment up front and then pay a monthly fee. People live independently in an apartment, but assisted living and nursing services are available.</p>\n<p><em>Assisted living facilities</em> help residents with daily living but don't give medical care. Generally, people get their own apartment and have access to a communal meal plan and group activities. Many facilities have special wings for people with dementia.</p>\n<p><em>Nursing homes</em> give round-the-clock care for people with serious healthcare needs or chronic diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>When choosing a facility, ask a lot of questions</strong>. Talk to administrators and workers who actually provide care. \"Ask if the facility has its own staff of nurses and healthcare providers,\" Minnix says. \"If they rely on rent-a-nurses or other outside agencies, that's not a good sign.\" Look for a staff turnover rate below about 30% and key leaders (such as the administrator and director of nursing) who've been in place for at least several years, he suggests. Also ask:</p>\n<p><em>Who owns the facility?</em> Often nursing homes have a donor-funded endowment or are supported by a larger organization such as a religious institution, which tells you others stand behind the facility.</p>\n<p><em>What are all the costs?</em> Are there upfront fees and/or monthly fees? What services can be added on later?</p>\n<p><em>How do you handle emergencies?</em> Some facilities take their residents directly to one specific hospital; others have trained medical staff on site.</p>\n<p><em>What happens if you run out of money? </em>Medicaid usually kicks in when resources are depleted, but it may not cover all services.</p>\n<p>Take mental notes on what you see. Are people having fun? Is there a lot going on? Is the dining service appealing? Can you see yourself and/or your kids enjoying a visit there? \"There's a stigma against senior housing, but often when I visit assisted living or new facilities for continuing care, I think, 'I want to move in here!' There's a full roster of social activities, art and exercise classes, transportation for shopping,\" says Joe Buckheit, founder and president of <a href=\"http://www.agingcare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AgingCare.com</a>, an online support community for caregivers. \"Caregiving involves many important, life-changing decisions. Caregivers and their families need to explore as many options as they can to figure out what works for everyone.\"</p>\n<p>RICHARD LALIBERTE is an award-winning health and medical writer whose work has appeared in <em>The New</em><em>York Times Magazine</em> and other publications<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\"I feel proud to be able to give back to my parents by taking care of my mother. I'm happy that I'm able to live out the principles and values that my parents modeled for me,\" says Julie Baldocchi, a 48-year-old from San Francisco.</p>\n<p>\"We have three generations under our roof,\" says work-at-home bookkeeper Valerie Mazur of Monaca, PA, whose 75-year-old mother has lived on and off with her, her husband and their 12- and 9-year-old daughters through a seemingly endless series of surgeries and health problems. \"I can usually work in the morning when the kids are in school and Mom sleeps, but otherwise, I'm generally taking care of my mother,\" Valerie says.</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Can I get paid for caregiving?</em></strong></h3>\n<p>In some states, there's a program known as Cash and Counseling, or participant-direct programs, in which seniors who qualify for Medicaid can receive funds to pay their caregivers&#151;whether they're friends, family members or a visiting nurse service. Medicaid makes an assessment to figure out how many hours of care each month will be covered and then pays that amount directly to the senior. In some states, the caregiver may have a say if she has power of attorney and is already making decisions on behalf of a loved one.

Anything with b-a-s-i-l,\" she says with a laugh, referring to the cocktail she orders, which happens to be garnished with a sprig of it. Forgive me for jumping to conclusions, but this is Chelsea Handler, after all, the late-night talk-show host who has elevated the drunken tell-all to a highly lucrative art form via three <em>New York Times</em> number-one best-sellers (including <em>Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea</em>), sold-out comedy tours, and two hit cable-TV shows on the E! network. Who better to star on the cover of REDBOOK's first-ever \"confessions\" issue? Sipping and spilling is what Chelsea does best &#151; and I, for one, am an unabashed fan. On her nightly show, <em>Chelsea Lately</em>, the comedian with a dwarf sidekick and a weakness for rappers and chubby babies outs what most of us would keep in: photos of herself and her staffers in compromising positions, her cup size (34D), and details of her sex life and private parts (which she refers to as her <em>coslopus</em> or <em>Pikachu</em>, depending on the context). And she certainly doesn't hold back when it comes to celebrities. \"Paris Hilton is going on a goodwill mission to Rwanda,\" she once said on the show, in her trademark raspy monotone. \"It's the first time an entire third-world country will have to get immunizations for a visitor.\" Chelsea's take-no-prisoners approach can be polarizing, but it has also won her 4.4 million followers on Twitter who can't get enough of her candor. If there were a Hollywood Walk of Shame, this decidedly non-golden girl would be the first one down on all fours &#151; and most likely face-planting right into the cement.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Or so I think. But &#151; surprise, surprise &#151; a sharp-tongued, foul-mouthed boozehound is not who I encounter when we meet. \"Cheers, girl!\" she says, as we clink glasses. \"It's nice to go out and have a drink in the middle of the week.\" Did I hear that right? Isn't she an every-night drinker? No, she explains. \"I <em>never</em> do this.\" When the food arrives, she instructs me to hand her my plate. As she dishes up salad, the salty blonde with the telltale dark roots seems far nicer than the acerbic persona we see on the small screen. Still dressed in what she wore on the air &#151; a soft-pink blouse, skinny gray jeans, and platform boots &#151; she talks about starting a foundation to nurture teenage girls, gushes over photos she's just snapped of her newest puppy, Gary, talks about scrapbooking (!), and starts to tear up as she reminisces about her mother, who died of complications from cancer in 2006. At the end of the evening, Chelsea announces she's going to pick me up the next day and that I should take down her cell number in case I need to reach her. At 9:30 the next morning, she phones to say she's running a little early. Her vibe is totally together and even... maternal.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Funnily enough, Chelsea plays a mother of three in February's <em>This Means War,</em> a romantic comedy starring her pal Reese Witherspoon. She'll also costar in <em>Fun Size,</em> out this fall, playing a mom to Nickelodeon darling Victoria Justice. And then there's her new NBC sitcom, <em>Are You There, Chelsea?</em>, in which she wears a brunette wig to play her own older sister Sloane. Her character gives birth in the first episode &#151; without an epidural. \"Personally, I'd have a baby just <em>for</em> the epidural,\" Chelsea quips to me. Okay, so maybe the sworn-to-be-single New Jersey native isn't quite ready to settle down, but over a few rounds of &#151; you guessed it &#151; vodka, we get Chelsea to make her biggest confession yet: She's kind of a sweetie.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>REDBOOK: I saw your family portrait on your desk. I couldn't believe that hunky guy with the big '70s hair is [your now-bald brother] Roy!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CHELSEA HANDLER: </strong>I know. Can you imagine peaking as a teen? I think if you peak in high school, there's a problem. That's what my sister always said: \"Don't worry, you'll peak later.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Did being the youngest of six shape you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CH:</strong> Yeah. People always tell me I need to have a kid, and I say, \"No, I don't.\" Because I wouldn't have just one kid; I'd have six. I need a huge family. So I just kind of fill my house with tons of rejects and misfits so it feels like I have a bunch of children.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Who lives with you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CH:</strong> Well, my brother Roy lives with me, and my friend Shelly, who's a lesbian from Dallas. And right now one of my assistants is living at my house because I got a new puppy and I didn't realize it needed to be housebroken, and I'm like, \"Ahhh, I'm not waking up every two hours to take this baby out.\" So it's really fun to go home and have a house full of people.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: That does sound like fun. Drinking has always been a big part of your shtick. Do you think there's a difference between being a lush and being an alcoholic?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CH:</strong> There is. Even though I joke about drinking all the time, people have the wrong idea about me &#151; that I drink every night. Actually I don't. I contain myself. I'm not a hot mess, you know? Very rarely do I get loopy, and if I do, it's at my house... or someone else's house. Not in public. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Well, I don't see how you could drink every night and accomplish everything you have. Then again, you became a star by breaking all the rules, from sleeping with your boss [Chelsea dated Ted Harbert, chairman of NBC Broadcasting and former president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, which owns E!, for four years] to dishing too much. Do you ever feel like you're an anti-authority figure?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CH:</strong> I definitely feel anti-authority. When I moved to California, I waited tables from the age of 19 to 25, until I got <em>Girls Behaving Badly </em>[an all-female prank show], and I got fired from every job because I could never listen to a manager who told me I'd be quizzed on the menu. I've always had a problem with authority. That's why I had to be my own boss. It's been amazing. I can't believe I'm able to get away with this kind of ridiculousness.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-10T17:55:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Fox","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641409","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

Is it less cute if I tell you that Mom was a little bit stoned?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Mind you, Alice is not a compulsive pot-smoker or a checked-out parent. She's the picture of health and happiness, an athlete with tons of energy for her family. Still, she smokes pot a couple of times a week, usually after the kids are in bed. She says she does it for fun or to chill out, and, occasionally, to get into what she calls the \"kid zone.\" \"If I had been perfectly sober, I would have just taken a walk, thinking about what I needed to do next,\" Alice says. \"I probably wouldn't have been all that engaged with my kids. But the stoned mama that I was that day made fun out of the mundane.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Lynn, a 32-year-old mother of three from Arlington, TX, would most certainly not find that story amusing. \"If you have to smoke pot to get through the day with your family, there is something wrong,\" she says. When Lynn was a teen, her mom used to smoke marijuana, and Lynn <em>hated</em> it. \"I knew it was illegal, and I knew it cost money we didn't have,\" she remembers. \"It's horrible that a parent would get high when their job is to be responsible.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Yet more and more parents are doing just that. A surprisingly high 18 percent of people ages 26 to 34, and 9 percent of those 35 to 49, have smoked pot in the last year, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (The data doesn't pinpoint how many of those people have kids, but we know that by age 44, about 80 percent of women do.)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This generation grew up with Dr. Dre's album <em>The Chronic</em> and movies like Cheech and Chong's <em>Up in Smoke</em>. Now they're juggling the demands of careers and children. And I found that, instead of having a gin and tonic like their mothers may have, a surprising number of today's moms are lighting a joint &#151; especially if they live in areas with vibrant alternative subcultures, like New Mexico, Colorado, or California. The advent of medical marijuana has certainly helped to legitimize pot in Los Angeles, where I live. (Dispensaries outnumber Starbucks in some neighborhoods.) But legalization is not only a California phenomenon: In many places, a joint and a stiff drink are viewed as roughly equivalent vices, if they're seen as vices at all.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>WHO'S MINDING THE KIDS?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of us wouldn't think twice about having a beer while home with the kids &#151; maybe even getting slightly tipsy. But getting <em>high</em>? \"If both parents are high, there is no adult in a position to give complete care to small children,\" says Melissa Wardy, 34, a mom of two from Janesville, WI. \"Last year, my 2-year-old son fell down our basement steps. Had we been stoned, we would not have been able to give him emergency care, nor drive him to the ER or make coherent decisions about his needs.\" Occasional users may think that safety concerns don't apply to them, but the less often they use pot, the more altered they will be when they do. \"If you're a regular user and you have a joint, you won't see much cognitive effect; you build up a tolerance,\" explains Carl Hart, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City, who has studied people's ability to function after taking the drug. \"But if you smoke on a more limited basis, you'll see a slowing down of behaviors and short-term memory disruptions.\" Case in point: Jamie, 41, a mom of three in Encinitas, CA, who says she smokes pot once or twice a year at a dinner party. \"When I smoke, I'm way altered,\" she says. \"I know I'm acting weird, and I'd never want my kids to be around that.\" Compare that to daily user Nanette, a 27-year-old mom from Huntington Beach, CA: \"I don't get stupid when I smoke &#151; I can do it throughout the day without feeling any different,\" she says. Elizabeth, a 26-year-old mother of two from Clovis, NM, smokes regularly, and insists that it helps her in stressful parenting situations. Recently, \"My son got a big splinter in his foot and was freaking out, but because I'd had a little weed, I was able to be super-calm and pluck it out quickly,\" she recalls. No expert recommends pot as a parenting aid (ideally, we'd all be calm enough to pluck out a splinter without lighting up a joint), but Hart says his research shows that \"most heavy users can focus and concentrate in situations of great consequence\" when they're high. \"That doesn't mean I think they should be driving the carpool,\" he says. \"The same warnings that would be on a bottle of Valium about driving and operating machinery apply.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"942484","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/Vo/rbk-pot-parents-0312-1-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Baumgardner","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641428","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/kids-family/pot-parents\">I'm a Parent Who Smokes Pot </a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/parents-marriage-advice\">What You Can Learn from Your Parents' Marriage(s)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/kids-health/drug-free-kids\">6 Ways to Help Kids (Including Yours) Stay Drug-Free</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/choosing-father-for-children\">Did You Pick the Right Co-Parent?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/how-to-deal/stay-calm-secrets\">Stay-Calm Secrets (From Women Who Should Know)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/how-olympic-moms-make-it-work\">How Olympic Moms Make It Work</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/breaking-bad-habits\">How 5 Moms Kicked Their Worst Health Habits (and You Can, Too)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/who-gets-breast-cancer\">Who Gets Breast Cancer and Who Survives?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/my-friend-is-a-bad-parent\">Girlfriend Therapy: My Friend May be an Unsafe Parent</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/i-always-dreamed-about-becoming-a-parent-video-1212096699001\">\"I always dreamed about becoming a parent.\" Video</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"headline_image_id":"942483","print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:14:18.000Z","author_id":"37811","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/kids-family/advice/pot-parents","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"We asked artists, architects, and designers to recreate the U.S. map to reflect the state of things","site_id":"13","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.esquire.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"jstavis","keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"5 Genius New Ways to Think About America's Map in 2012","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-02-13T22:08:20.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Mark","source_id":"1","teaser":"We asked artists, architects, and designers to recreate the U.S. map to reflect the state of things","origin_site_id":"13","sub_heading":"Red state, blue state, big state, small state, north and south and east and west: How we define our similarities and differences with each other often comes down to where we see ourselves on the map of America.

The phone chained us to our desk. Then the computer chained us to our desk. And then our work tools became mobile, and so we became mobile, and the distance we were willing to travel to and from work gradually rose. In collaboration with AT&T Labs Research, Carlo Ratti and his team at MIT's SENSEable City Lab &#151; a research group that blends architectural concepts with emerging technology &#151; used anonymous, aggregated cell phone data to prove just how mobile we've become and to explore our evolving definition of state lines. \"Today, everywhere is a workplace,\" Ratti says. \"We see people doing their work, using a railway station as an office. An airport as an office. Starbucks as an office. Because of that, our lifestyle is changing, and the fact that people commute from very, very far away is one side of that.\" The data was compiled during the month of July 2010 from several million commuters who communicated via cell phone; the colored dots represent the commuters' home locations, while the rings and their intensity represent the number of commuters traveling. The resulting map shows a breaking down of the traditional idea of a nation of states, and, instead, an ever-expanding urban sprawl that pushes the limits of our respective cities.

New research shows that both deliver unexpected health pluses. A 2011 Harvard study, for example, found that female coffee drinkers who averaged four cups a day cut their risk of endometrial cancer 25% and, with more than three cups of caffeinated java, lowered their odds of basal-cell carcinoma 20%. Tea, too, contains cancer-fighting antioxidants. The beverages may also be mood boosters, with coffee linked to a decreased risk of depression and tea to less anxiety. To get the most from your morning mug:</p>\n<p><strong>1. GO FOR THE HIGH-OCTANE (IF YOU CAN)</strong> <br />The health bonuses haven't been found as consistently in decaf versions of coffee and tea. But since regular coffee can pack as much as 200 mg of caffeine per eight-ounce cup (depending on the bean and the way it's brewed) and tea can go up to 60 mg per cup, stick with decaf if you have a GI issue like irritable bowel syndrome or acid reflux. Ditto if you suffer from anxiety or sleep disturbances &#151; or if you're simply sensitive to caffeine. You'll still get some benefit from other compounds in your brew, such as the antioxidant chlorogenic acid in coffee.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SKIP THE CREAMER</strong><br />Adding nondairy creamer and sugar to coffee interferes with the absorption of antioxidants, a Swiss study suggested. Also, creamers are often made with partially hydrogenated oils, which contain heart-damaging trans fats. To lighten your coffee, use cow's milk or soy or almond milk instead.</p>\n<p><strong>3. TAKE YOUR TEA BLACK</strong> <br />Adding milk may blunt its heart-health benefits, a German study found. And speaking of black, green tea may be the health star, but all members of the <em>Camellia sinensis</em> family &#151; black, white, and oolong tea, as well as green &#151; have health benefits, including aiding in fighting infections and slowing cognitive decline.</p>\n<p><strong>4. FAVOR FILTERS </strong><br />Coffee brewed without a paper filter &#151; in a French press or espresso pot, for example &#151; retains an oily residue that contains cafestol, a substance that raises levels of heart-damaging LDL cholesterol. You could &#151; if you're addicted to your French press &#151; pour your coffee through a paper filter into a cup. Or, just save special brews for an occasion &#151; breakfast in bed, anyone?</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"941383","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/oQ/cup-of-coffee-1210-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Meltzer Warren, M.S., R.D.","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641942","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/nutrition/nutrition-news-0308\">Nutrition and Health News for March 2008</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/nutrition/nutrition-news-0108\">Nutrition News: January 2008</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/nutrition/caffeine-content-breakdown-beverages\">Caffeine Content: Cola vs. Citrus</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/best-immune-boosting-foods\">Fend off the Flu with these 6 Immune-Boosting Foods</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/travel-products/travel-coffee-mug-reviews/travel-mugs-tested\">Travel Coffee (and Tea ) Mugs Tested</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/aladdin-ebony-duo-coffee-tea-travel-press-486\">Aladdin Ebony Duo Coffee &amp; Tea Travel Press</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/thermos-nissan-tea-tumbler-infuser-588\">Thermos Nissan Tea Tumbler with Infuser</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/health-benefits-organization\">7 Health Benefits of Being Organized</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/nutrition/nutrition-news-0408\">Nutrition News: April 2008</a><br>\n<a href=\"/holidays/halloween-ideas/avoid-caffeinated-candy\">Avoid Caffeine -Heavy Halloween Candy</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:32:15.000Z","author_id":"11270","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/womens-health/health-benefits-of-coffee","issue_date":"March 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"How to avoid overpaying or underpaying","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"irs, refund check, taxes, withholding, overpay taxes, underpay taxes","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Simple Solutions for Tax Troubles","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-29T20:53:42.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/burned-toaster-refund-1202","link_text":"How Do I Get a Refund for My Recalled Toaster?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/family/how-to-pay-your-taxes","link_text":"No More Tax Trauma!"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/consumer-protection/cell-phone-problems-1102","link_text":"Can I Get a Refund for My Prepaid Cell Phone?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/how-to-prevent-bed-bugs","link_text":"How to Check for Bedbugs"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/burberry-check-rainboots-715","link_text":"Burberry Check Rainboots"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/burberry-black-grey-check-trench-coat-1031","link_text":"Burberry Black and Grey Check Trench Coat"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/burberry-compact-check-umbrella-657","link_text":"Burberry Compact Check Umbrella"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/best-check-in-luggage","link_text":"The Best Lightweight Check -in Luggage"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/home-products/top-window-treatments","link_text":"10 Top Window Treatment Trends"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/product-reviews/consumer-protection/gh-rescue-bank-0704","link_text":"How Can I Get Back Money That My Bank Owes?"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Carmen","source_id":"10","teaser":"Most of us overpay or underpay...and neither is good.

I'm going to get the biggest refund check this year!\" And every year, I meet those smiles with a furrowed brow and some serious concerns about how those people are managing their money.</p>\n<p>Believe me, I'm not a fan of bursting bubbles (or erasing grins), but getting a fat tax-refund check is not a money-savvy move. Yet the number of refund recipients is about 75% of tax filers &#151; way too high!</p>\n<p>Now, of course I'm not suggesting you should err in the opposite direction and wind up owing the IRS big-time come spring. My goal is to help you get as close as possible to breaking even, so your money is working for you year-round. Here's how to find that nice middle ground.</p>\n<h3>NO MORE \"HOORAY FOR REFUNDS!\"</h3>\n<p>Here's why most people are such fans of that big money-back check: Their overpayments have functioned as an automatic savings account. The National Retail Federation reported last year that 42% of filers said they were putting their refunds toward paying down debt. In other words, they were letting the IRS save an average of $250 a month for them. But wouldn't you rather have an extra $250 a month in your paycheck? Even if savings-account interest rates are super-low these days, any money in the bank does protect you should you lose your job. And if you have high-interest credit card debt, why not chip away at it rather than overpay on your taxes?</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you're saddled all year with $4,000 in credit card debt at 18% interest, and you're just waiting until April for your refund check to pay it off. While you're waiting, that bill grows as interest compounds every month. Let's make the payoff magic happen in a less pricey way:</p>\n<p><strong>Lower your withholding </strong>for this year (the amount that goes toward taxes &#151; more on that in a sec), which can leave you with another, say, couple of hundred dollars or so in pay per month.</p>\n<p><strong>On the same day </strong>(don't give yourself any breathing room, or you may spend that newfound money), sign up to make automated payments to your credit card of $333 every month. By doing so, you'll pay that bill off completely in one year and one month, saving, say, $300 in interest, versus just paying the minimum amount due every month for a year while waiting for your refund to squash that balance. Alternatively, you could add that $333 every month to your 401(k), netting you an extra nest egg of $157,000, calculated using a conservative estimate of 6% annual return over 20 years.</p>\n<p>Convinced? I sure hope so. Now, here's how to shrink your refund without ending up owing the IRS: First, with your tax return from last year in hand for reference, head to <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">irs.gov</a>. In the Search box, type \"withholding calculator.\" Click the first link, then fill out a questionnaire that will calculate what you should claim on your W-4 withholding form to break even. I checked in with Mary Kay Foss, a CPA in Danville, CA, who said, \"A $4,000 federal refund on a joint net income of $70,000 to $140,000 represents four withholding allowances fewer than most people probably need. By adding more allowances to their W-4, they'll be able to get out of the overpaying-on-taxes habit.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"/family/budget/how-to-pay-your-taxes-2\">What to do if you owe the IRS money </a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"940826","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/Ww/tax-frustration-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Wong Ulrich","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-carmen-wong-ulrich","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6641928","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/product-reviews/burned-toaster-refund-1202\">How Do I Get a Refund for My Recalled Toaster?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/how-to-pay-your-taxes\">No More Tax Trauma!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/consumer-protection/cell-phone-problems-1102\">Can I Get a Refund for My Prepaid Cell Phone?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/how-to-prevent-bed-bugs\">How to Check for Bedbugs</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/burberry-check-rainboots-715\">Burberry Check Rainboots</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/burberry-black-grey-check-trench-coat-1031\">Burberry Black and Grey Check Trench Coat</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/burberry-compact-check-umbrella-657\">Burberry Compact Check Umbrella</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/best-check-in-luggage\">The Best Lightweight Check -in Luggage</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/home-products/top-window-treatments\">10 Top Window Treatment Trends</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/consumer-protection/gh-rescue-bank-0704\">How Can I Get Back Money That My Bank Owes?</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:32:12.000Z","author_id":"11564","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/budget/how-to-pay-your-taxes","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Avery","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":null,"related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"WomansDay.com","source_id":"1","teaser":"<p><em>Each day we will post an adorable picture or video of one of our readers' cute kids.</em></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"image_id__935913\" src=\"/cm/womansday/images/Xd/a1very.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"340\" /></p>","origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"Avery-Kaylen_","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-01-26T17:49:53.000Z","title":"Avery","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Avery","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"818","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"HDMMAGNUS-3710","last_name":"Staff","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-11-30T19:49:28.000Z","id":"11903","last_updated_date":"2011-11-30T19:49:28.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"WomansDay.com"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":[{"blog_element":[{"__total_count__":1,"paragraph":"<p><img class=\"image_id__935914\" src=\"/cm/womansday/images/3d/a11very.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"340\" /></p>\n<p>Avery loves her doll!</p>\n<p>Thank you Dana for submitting!</p>\n<p><em><strong>We want to see more of your adorable kid pictures and videos.

Set your feet shoulder-width apart, with toes pointing slightly out. While keeping your weight on your heels, start pushing your hips back and towards the floor. Your hips should move before your knees bend.</p>\n<p>Keep your chest up and try to wedge your elbows in between your knees at the bottom point of the movement &#150; when your posterior is level with your thighs. Even if you can&#146;t reach your knees, focus on pushing them slightly apart. Initiate the second part of the move by driving your hips forward to return to the start position.</p>\n<h3>When to do it</h3>\n<p>Try to do goblet squats early in your training day so you are fresh and less likely to deviate from proper form.
