all the talk of how we should help kids stay healthy and fight childhood obesity, my mind keeps returning to the same thought: Teach them to cook! In my home, the kitchen is an extension of the family room, and my three teen boys have helped me cook since they were small. Teaching your kids to cook doesn&#146;t mean that you have to turn them loose on their own. It just means letting them play an active role in meal planning, preparation&#151;and cleanup. Training little chefs is easy. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep it clean. </strong>Teach good sanitation habits early, like basic hand-washing techniques using warm water and soap. I always tell my culinary school students to sing two rounds of &#147;Happy Birthday&#148; while washing their hands.<br /> &#160;</li>\n<li><strong>Mix it up. </strong>Start them with mixing and kneading tasks. Herb blends and spice rubs (see chapter 12 of <a href=\"http://www.sparkpeople.com/linkexchange.asp?ic=29&il=4739&lnk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Esparkpeople%2Ecom%2Fcookbook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The SparkPeople Cookbook: Love Your Food, Lose the Weight</em></strong></a>) are a great idea as a first mixing experience&#151;just make sure they wash their hands when finished and keep hands away from eyes and mouths if any hot spices are involved.</li>\n</ol><ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><strong>Savor the experience. </strong>I would encourage you to start with savory ingredients and save the sweet recipes for later. Remember when you started feeding your infant real food and the pediatrician suggested starting with vegetables? It&#146;s the same principle.</li>\n</ol><ol>\n<li value=\"4\"><strong>Sweeten the deal.</strong> Once you are ready to move to sweet recipes, I would start with smoothies (see page 81) and let them experiment with different flavors. Try adding some protein and fiber to the mixes by including yogurt, ground flaxseed or wheat germ. Encourage seasonal eating when selecting the fruits and vegetables.</li>\n</ol><ol>\n<li value=\"5\"><strong>Herbal remedy.</strong> Bits of unidentified green objects on a plate can be intimidating to a child. Purchase herb clippers and ask your petite chef to help with the meal by cutting fresh herbs. If you don&#146;t have the clippers, just use a clean pair of kitchen scissors. Encourage them to taste each herb and tell them which flavors pair well with which foods. (See chapter 12 for more info on herbs and spices.)</li>\n</ol><ol>\n<li value=\"6\"><strong>Start chopping. </strong>When your chef is ready to cut vegetables with a knife, choose a small, nonserrated paring knife. Start with semi-soft vegetables and fruits like cucumbers, tomatoes, summer squash, bananas and peaches. Once they feel comfortable with these, move to harder vegetables like carrots or potatoes. I would reserve any very hard winter root vegetables such as butternut squash or yams for adult hands only.</li>\n</ol><ol>\n<li value=\"7\"><strong>Make it a teaching moment. </strong>Make the experience an extension of the classroom. One of my fondest memories of cooking with my mother was during International Week at my grade school. I chose France and asked my mother to help me make chocolate &#233;clairs. The basic &#233;clairs are made with <em>p&#226;te au choux</em> pastry dough&#151;a big undertaking for an 11-year-old, but with her help they were a success. I remember how she helped me multiply the recipe so that we tripled the ingredients to make enough for the whole class. I did not know it at the time, but it was a valuable lesson in math. I have taken that same concept and applied it at home. We let our kids pick a foreign country and have them research the native dishes. We make a field trip to an international grocery store and explore.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're trying to get your kids to eat healthier meals, <em>The SparkPeople Cookbook</em> can help. My three teen boys tested every recipe with me. If they didn&#146;t like it, the recipe didn't make it into the cookbook. In addition to an entire chapter on teaching kids to eat right and getting them excited about healthy cooking, we designate many recipes with a \"kid-friendly\" icon to point out dishes that will please picky palates.</p>\n<p><br />Happy cooking!</p>\n<p><strong>Related Links from SparkPeople.com:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sparkpeople.com/linkexchange.asp?ic=21&il=1833&lnk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Esparkpeople%2Ecom\" target=\"_blank\">Get a Free Personalized Weight-Loss Plan</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sparkpeople.com/linkexchange.asp?ic=21&il=7904&lnk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edailyspark%2Ecom%2Fblog%2Easp%3Fpost%3D10%5Ffilling%5Fhealthy%5Flunches\" target=\"_blank\">10 Filling, Healthy Lunches</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sparkpeople.com/linkexchange.asp?ic=21&il=7905&lnk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edailyspark%2Ecom%2Fblog%2Easp%3Fpost%3Dwinters%5Fharvest%5Fsparkrecipes\" target=\"_blank\">Turn Winter Vegetables into Tasty Recipes</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2013-01-18T14:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"941091","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/BM/mother-daughter-salad-tossing-kitchen-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mcepeda@hearst.com","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6652094","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-01-18T20:18:22.000Z","author_id":"16885","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-06T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-shortcuts/kids-cooking","issue_date":"SparkPeople.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"This recipe from Jamie Oliver uses healthy chicken broth as its base instead of cream.","site_id":"11","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.countryliving.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"potato dish, potatoes, soup, leek, potato soup, healthy recipe, healthy soup","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Potato-Leek Soup","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-01-17T16:32:01.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/comfort-foods-1109","link_text":"Best Comfort Food Recipes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/potatoes","link_text":"In Praise of Potatoes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/chilled-soup-0809","link_text":"Chilled Summer Soups"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/videos/storing-homemade-soups-video-4984669001","link_text":"Storing Homemade Soups Video"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/ask-the-expert/cats-nutrition-0210","link_text":"What's the Healthiest Thing to Feed My Cat?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/seasonal-soups-1008","link_text":"Seasonal Soups"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/mushroom-soup-recipes","link_text":"Mushroom Soup Recipes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/best-thanksgiving-side-dishes","link_text":"50 Classic Thanksgiving Side Dishes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/chicken-soup-recipes","link_text":"Chicken Soup Recipes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/cooking/simple-potato-recipes-1110","link_text":"Simple Potato Recipes"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Jamie","source_id":"1","teaser":"Potato soups are often heavy, creamy, and full of fat.

You may have also heard that Rihanna recently told Oprah that she still loves Chris and that they're \"very very close friends.\" And no doubt, you&#146;re fully aware that three years ago, Chris beat the living daylights out of Rihanna.\n<br /> <br />\n\nThe question we&#146;ve been asking around the Cosmo office is &#147;Why?&#148; Why would a woman who had been hurt so badly by someone be friends with him again and even go so far as to say she loves him?\n<br /> <br />\n\n&#147;You go back to what you know,&#148; says relationship therapist Barton Goldsmith, PhD, author of <i>Emotional Fitness for Intimacy</i>. Like Chris, he says that someone who was violent will always be apologetic and beg for forgiveness. He&#146;ll point out that he&#146;s done anger management classes, reformed his ways, and will never do it again&#151;but it&#146;s a big risk to take a guy back who has been violent toward you in the past. \n<br /> <br />\n\nRelationship therapist Bethany Marshall, PhD, author of <i>Deal Breakers</i>, points out that people can change, but if a guy has a history of violence, he&#146;s likely to lash out again in the future. Case in point: Chris had a meltdown after appearing on <i>Good Morning America</i> last year and threw a chair out of a window. He&#146;s also ranted on Twitter several times about people he dislikes and just recently said &#147;f--- off&#148; to &#147;haters,&#148; while bragging about the fact that he won a Grammy. To us, that sounds like someone who just doesn&#146;t get it.\n<br /> <br />\n\nNot only that, having a relationship with a guy who has abused you in the past subconsciously tells him that he can get away with anything, says Marshall. Sure, at first he&#146;ll be on his best behavior, but eventually he&#146;s likely to regress into his old bad habits.\n<br /> <br />\n\nIf a guy has hurt you in the past, Goldsmith recommends you move on, cut off contact from him, and get counseling. &#147;You&#146;ve been traumatized, and you don&#146;t know how that trauma will surface later in your life,&#148; says Goldsmith. &#147;It can really mess with your head.&#148;\n<br /> <br />\n\nOf course, it is possible that Chris has finally learned his lesson and we certainly hope that he&#146;s changed. Regardless, our advice to Rihanna: It's fine to wish Chris well, but it would be best for both of you to move on from each other for good.\n<br /> <br />\nIf you or someone you know has been the victim of violence, please contact the <a href=\"http://www.thehotline.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> for more information on how to get help.\n<br /> <br />\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-07T11:13:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"7135","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Miller","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"korinmiller","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6814204","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/advice/chris-brown-rihanna-kiss\">So, Rihanna and Chris Brown Kissed...</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/violent-guys\">Could Your Guy Turn Violent ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/get-ex-boyfriend-back\">How to Get Your Ex -Boyfriend Back</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/worst-of-2012\">Worst of 2012: Things That Need to Go Away in 2013</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/rihanna-july-2011-cover\">Rihanna is our July Cover Girl!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/break-toxic-love-pattern\">How to Break a Toxic Love Pattern</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/hot-guys/ffm-chris-brown\">Fun Fearless Males 2008: Chris Brown </a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/biggest-celebrity-breakups-2012\">The Biggest Celeb Breakups of 2012</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/embarrassing-celebrity-moments\">12 Embarrassing Celebrity Moments</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/celebrity-tattoos\">Celebrity Tattoos That Shouldn't Have Happened</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T07:24:35.000Z","author_id":"8518","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"cosmopolitan","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-22T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Cosmopolitan","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/advice/chris-brown-rihanna-kiss","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"pasta recipes, mac and cheese recipes, Creamy Double-Cheese Sauce with Pasta, lowfat mac and cheese, creamy pasta, healthy mac and cheese","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Creamy Double-Cheese Sauce with Pasta","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-08-23T13:31:08.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Woman's Day Kitchen","source_id":"1","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"creamy-double-cheese-sauce-with-pasta-recipe","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-02-18T21:58:17.000Z","title":"Creamy Double-Cheese Sauce with Pasta","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Creamy Double-Cheese Sauce with Pasta &#150;

wonder what your husband&#146;s friends really think of you&#151;and your marriage? You may be surprised to learn that your joking eye rolls at your spouse&#146;s corny jokes make his friends feel bad for him&#151;or heartened to find out that his closest pals want to see you more. &#147;People outside your marriage can often see blind spots we can&#146;t see,&#148; says Julie Hanks, LCSW, BCD, director of <a href=\"http://www.wasatchfamilytherapy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wasatch Family Therapy</a>, which has multiple locations in Utah. We asked men to share their thoughts on their buds&#146; wives. Read on to see if you recognize yourself in any of the below, and discover how you can benefit from these guys&#146; feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;We think you're judging us</strong>.&#148;</p>\n<p>Scott* is convinced that his oldest friend&#146;s wife is a snob. &#147;Whenever we tell stories from years ago, she rolls her eyes as if to say we&#146;re pathetic for living in the past.&#148; Even if you never say a thing about your husband&#146;s and his pals&#146; antics, your eye-rolling can send the message that you think you&#146;re above them when you like them just fine. Perhaps you feel threatened by the amount of time your husband spends with his buddies, especially if their association predates you, says Elizabeth Lombardo, PhD, author of <a href=\"http://www.ahappyyou.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Happy You</em>.</a> So avoid setting up a &#147;you versus them&#148; dynamic. You need not adore all your partner&#146;s cronies, but your husband will appreciate it if you accept them cheerfully, noting the positive things they give him, like sharing memories of college.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;We wish you&#146;d spend more time with us.</strong>&#148;</p>\n<p>The good news from this obvious compliment is that they like you. The bad news? They think you don&#146;t want to see them. &#147;It&#146;s cool that they want to get to know you; they value your husband enough to want to spend more time with the whole family,&#148; says Hanks. So take the hint. You don&#146;t have to go to every softball game, but consider inviting them and their significant others out for dinner. Or when they call, at least talk to them for a minute (&#147;How&#146;s work? What&#146;s new at home?&#148;) before handing the phone to your hubby.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;We hate when you call him 10 times during poker night.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Jeff* gets annoyed and defensive when his friend&#146;s wife phones more than once during a guys&#146; night. &#147;Why doesn&#146;t she trust him after all these years? It&#146;s not like he&#146;s doing anything wrong!&#148; But it might not even be a matter of trust, says Dr. Lombardo. &#147;Often, when the husband is out and the wife is home, maybe with the kids driving her crazy, her stress levels go up and make her do things she wouldn&#146;t ordinarily do&#150;&#150;like texting or calling incessantly.&#148; But you don&#146;t<em> </em>want to be seen as a nagging wife. And how would you feel if your husband called you every few minutes when you&#146;re out with a friend? Unless you need him for a legitimate reason, don&#146;t check in multiple times. <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#147;We&#146;re annoyed that you often come up with an &#145;emergency&#146; to cancel plans.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>When you chronically cancel on a friend, they feel devalued, says Hanks&#151;no wonder his chums don&#146;t think you take their relationship with your husband seriously. Ask yourself: Is there a pattern of forcing your husband to back out of plans with all his friends? Or does it happen only with a particular friend you aren&#146;t crazy about? Instead of sabotaging time your spouse spends with his friends, &#147;take a page from his book and arrange your own social plans,&#148; recommends Dr. Lombardo. That said, if he truly is<em> </em>spending more time with the boys than with you, Dr. Lombardo suggests explaining what you want assertively (&#147;I would love some time for just the two of us. How about we go on a date this weekend? I&#146;ve already lined up a babysitter.&#148;), rather than passive-aggressively (&#147;Oh, sure, go out with them again. I don&#146;t <em>care!&#148;</em>).</p>\n<p>&#160;<strong>&#147;You can be dismissive of your husband</strong>.&#148;</p>\n<p>&#147;If your husband&#146;s friends are true ones, they&#146;ll defend him if they see you putting him down,&#148; says Hanks. That describes Frank&#146;s* experience: &#147;My good friend&#146;s wife always<em> </em>belittles what he says. It makes me feel terrible for him and angry with her.&#148; While this loyalty is a tribute to your husband, it&#146;s a wake-up call for you. Maybe your tongue is too sharp or your attempts at humor are taken the wrong way. Or perhaps you correct his mistakes to prove you&#146;re smarter. Explore whether there&#146;s some buried resentment that&#146;s making you disparage your husband in public, and deal with that behind closed doors, says Hanks. It&#146;s better to keep your mouth shut rather than put him down, which shows a lack of respect, she adds. In the meantime, try to see your spouse the way his friends see him&#150;&#150;as a great guy who deserves your support.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;We hate that you begrudge him every dime he spends when you throw cash around all the time.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Do you think the money your husband drops on restoring his classic car is extravagant? Perhaps he and his friends think it&#146;s frivolous that you get your roots touched up every six weeks. &#147;This comes down to a mismatch in values, a common issue in marriage,&#148; says Hanks. &#147;Unless one of you is spending large amounts of money without telling the other, tolerate (within reason) what your husband spends on his hobbies, knowing you have your own priorities.&#148; Hanks advises having regular check-ins about financial matters during which you discuss the big stuff (college savings, retirement) as well as your personal spending. If you&#146;re worried about how much money he&#146;s going through, tell him, and ask him if he has any concerns about your spending, says Hanks.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;You&#146;re a beautiful 40-year-old; why are you dressing like you&#146;re 21?&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>Jake* is uncomfortable when he sees his good friend&#146;s wife dressing like her teenage daughter. &#147;It makes me wonder if she thinks her husband doesn&#146;t find her attractive anymore.&#148; Your man&#146;s friends may, like Jake, guess at what&#146;s behind the Forever 21 look&#150;&#150;others might simply feel uncomfortable around you. If you dress the way you do purely because you love it, don&#146;t worry about what anyone else thinks. That said, notes Dr. Lombardo, &#147;be careful you&#146;re not trying to be someone you aren&#146;t or solicit extra attention.&#148; And if it&#146;s true that your husband and his friends think you&#146;re beautiful when you dress and act your age, well, that&#146;s one good reason to shop where grown women do.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;You&#146;ve changed your husband for the better!&#148; </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>&#147;I have a friend who was kind of a mess before he got married. His apartment was like a dorm room, he never exercised and he always ordered fried food,&#148; says Rod.* &#147;Now that he&#146;s married, the rough edges are smoothed out.&#148; And Rod completely credits his pal&#146;s wife for the positive change. Guys like Rod may never share this praise with you because they don&#146;t want to offend you or your husband, don&#146;t feel close enough to you or aren&#146;t comfortable bringing up the subject. But take this as a reminder to work to bring out the best in your husband, says Dr. Lombardo. &#147;It&#146;s good for him, sure, but also for you because it fills you with positive energy.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;It&#146;s annoying when you intercept texts and phone calls.&#148; </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Steven* was shocked to discover that a friend&#146;s wife had been reading texts her husband received. &#147;It made me think she&#146;s insecure, and it turned me off her,&#148; he says. Same goes for interrupting phone calls, assuming the friends aren&#146;t ringing at bad times, like when you sit down to dinner or are putting the kids to bed. &#147;His pals might perceive that you&#146;re keeping him on a short leash,&#148; says Hanks. Again, think about why you&#146;re acting this way. Are you envious<em> </em>that he&#146;s on the phone with the guys and not plopped on the couch next to you? Are you worried they&#146;re talking about topics that would upset you? Then tell your husband directly, says Dr. Lombardo.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;You flirt with us.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>True, some women are<em> </em>friendlier than others. But if you&#146;re trying to get your husband&#146;s<em> </em>attention&#150;&#150;by sparking jealousy, say&#150;&#150;his inner circle may notice. &#147;Try to see how people around you perceive your behavior,&#148; suggests Dr. Lombardo. Is everyone having a good time and joking back and forth? That&#146;s fine. But if you suspect you&#146;re making someone uncomfortable, rein it in. And if you&#146;d like more attention from your husband, &#147;flirt with <em>him!&#148; </em>says Hanks.</p>\n<p><em>*Names have been changed.</em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-07-23T15:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"950719","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/2H/group-men-women-drinking-beer-bar-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Schipani","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mvanderburg","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6789370","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-01-18T19:42:37.000Z","author_id":"12613","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-21T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/dating-marriage/ten-things-your-husbands-friends-wont-tell-you","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The latest trends, treatments, and products for men's skincare.","site_id":"13","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.esquire.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"moisturizer, skincare products, skincare, wash, shave, skin, grooming","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Skincare for Men","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-01-17T18:00:44.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/features/ESQ1006MAINT_103","link_text":"The Esquire Grooming Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style/skincare","link_text":"Best Skincare for Men"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style/grooming/2008-grooming-awards","link_text":"The 2008 Grooming Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style/deodorant-grooming-awards-2012-1012","link_text":"The 2012 Esquire Grooming Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style/grooming/groomingawards2007","link_text":"The 2007 Esquire Grooming Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style/mens-grooming-products-2011-1011","link_text":"The 2011 Esquire Grooming Awards"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/the-side/best-expensive-grooming-products-2012","link_text":"15 Grooming Products Worth Splurging On"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/the-side/winter-grooming-products-2012","link_text":"15 Affordable Grooming Products for Winter"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/the-side/feature/skins-mtv-controversy-5235797","link_text":"Skins vs. Actual Teenagers: There Is a Difference"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/the-side/style-guides/men-with-beards","link_text":"The Greatest Shave in the History of Shaves"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"1","teaser":"The latest trends, treatments, and products for men's skincare.","origin_site_id":"13","sub_heading":"Editors' picks for the latest skincare products and treatments.

These tools cut, plunge-cut, flush-cut against a surface, grind, sand, remove grout, scrape out caulk and crumbling window putty, and work in tight spots that are inaccessible to other power tools. They accomplish this with a fine, high-speed oscillating motion that gives you impressive control without kickback and with little vibration. A wide range of odd-looking saw blades, grinding discs, and sanding pads can be used with the tool. And the price of these attachments has fallen dramatically in the past couple of years, as has the cost of the tools themselves.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe gathered nine corded oscillating tools and went to work, sawing through door trim, grinding away thin-set mortar, slicing through grout, and sanding away paint, putting a stopwatch to our results when we could and just running flat out when we couldn't.

CLICK, CLACK.</i></strong></span> The clatter of aluminum carabiners clipping and unclipping fills the air on this late summer afternoon. Pendulous clouds drape the upper slopes of Spruce Knob, the highest peak in West Virginia, and threaten rain. At the moment, though, only a fine mist penetrates a canopy of oak and locust at the base of Nelson Rocks, where guide Josh Armstrong and I watch nine climbers, led by guide Jason Cain, scale a 100-foot-high quartzite cliff on ladder-like rungs anchored in the rock. Each climber wears a harness with a pair of carabiners on lanyards clipped to a steel safety cable that runs alongside the rungs. At 6-foot intervals, when a climber reaches one of the eyebolts that anchor the cable to the cliff, he or she detaches one carabiner from the cable, clips it back on the cable above the bolt, and then does likewise with the trailing carabiner. <i>Click. Clack.</i>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n\"You're up,\" Armstrong says. He isn't a rock-climbing guide in the traditional sense. No rope runs &#173;reassuringly through his expert hands to my climbing harness. He can't catch me if I fall&#151;and falls are heavily discouraged. Slipping off the metal rungs might cause more &#173;injury than a fall while roped and on &#173;belay in conventional rock climbing. \"We don't have a dynamic rope to catch us, or someone on the ground to absorb the shock of our fall,\" Cain said before the climb. \"We are falling on stainless-steel cable. Doesn't stretch much. These lanyards? Not going to stretch much. We can generate a lot of force with a fall. It's &#173;going to hurt. So no falls.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNo falls. Okay. A familiar nervous anticipation overtakes me. I have a fair amount of experience on rock, though it's been a while since I've ascended anything higher than a 30-foot climbing wall. But with all this metal support, I'm confident enough to clip both carabiners to the steel safety cable, grab a rung, and start to climb. I won't unclip for 5 hours.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>The Tools of Via Ferrata Rock Climbing</strong></h3><br />\n\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/recreation/hiking/the-tools-of-via-ferrata-rock-climbing\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/FS/via-ferrata-slideshow-495x170-042712.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The Tools of Via Ferrata Climbing\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>A fixed anchoring system like the one at</strong></span> Nelson Rocks is known as a via ferrata&#151;Italian for \"iron road.\" It stays put while the climbers move on: no ropes to lug, no specialized gear to buy, no esoteric techniques to learn. These networks of ladders, cables, and bridges were developed in the &#173;Dolomites during World War I, when they were used to move supplies and infantry through &#173;otherwise impassable terrain. After the war, mountaineers took over the routes, and today, hundreds of via ferratas enable even raw beginners to access dramatic ridges and peaks in the Alps and Pyrenees.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn this side of the Atlantic, however, via ferratas are practically &#173;unknown. The route at &#173;Nelson Rocks is one of only a handful in the U.S. and Canada, although Whistler Blackcomb in British &#173;Columbia and other ski areas have discovered that the iron roads can complement summertime ziplines and waterfall canyoneering.    \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAt the Nelson Rocks Outdoor Center, the 1750 feet of &#190;-inch aircraft-grade stainless-steel cable (tensile strength: 11,800 pounds), the 115 stainless-steel rungs, and the 145 iron bolt hangers that went into building the via ferrata open one of the most unusual geologic formations in the East to exploration. Parallel fins of exposed &#173;Tuscarora quartzite rise high above the North Fork Valley like the bony plates on the back of a stegosaurus.

It was fine when I put it away. What happened?<br /><br />","__total_count__":1,"sender":"","answer":"A Lithium-ion batteries are the problem child of modern electronics. They leave your laptop juiceless after just a few hours. They send you hunting for power outlets at the least opportune times. They're the reason \"sorry, my phone's about to die\" has become as common a sign-off as \"goodbye\" in modern cellphone conversations. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nLess obvious than low capacity is the problem of longevity. Lithium-ion and even newer lithium-polymer batteries have a nasty habit of losing capacity over time or, worse, dying altogether. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAny battery issue is by definition a chemistry problem. In a healthy battery, ions flow freely between a cathode and an anode. Charging a battery forces ions from the cathode to the anode; using the battery reverses the flow. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOver time, this process wears out the cathode, which results in reduced capacity. A high-end lithium-polymer battery can lose about 20 percent of its capacity after 1000 charge cycles. Another way to think of this is to imagine that every time you recharge your laptop, you shave a few seconds off its maximum battery life. Erratic charging and heat speed up this degradation. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAnd batteries degrade even if you don't use them. According to battery-testing firm Cadex Electronics, a fully charged lithium-ion battery will lose about 20 percent of its capacity after a year of typical storage. Increase the temperature to just above 100 degrees Fahrenheit&#151;as in a hot attic, for example&#151;and that number is 35 percent. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn the other hand, an <i>empty</i> battery pack can eventually fall into \"deep discharge,\" at which point the battery's protection circuit&#151;intended to prevent power from reaching defective battery cells&#151;is triggered. This leaves the battery unable to charge at all. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nYour best bet for long-term battery storage is to run the charge down to 50 percent, remove the battery from the device, and keep it cool. But even ideal storage conditions can leave you with a dead battery after three or four years.  \n\n<br /><br />"}],"intro_text":""}],"article_type_name":"Q & A","publish_date":"2012-04-25T21:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Herrman","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"qanda","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6705747","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/tools/science-of-battery-life-in-electronics\">The Last Word on Battery Longevity in Gadgets </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/blackberry-torch-phone-review\">Can the BlackBerry Torch Catch Up to the iPhone and Android ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/gadgets/4300632\">How to Improve Battery Life on Any Gadget</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4221334\">Apple iPod Touch, iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, Cheaper iPhone and More: Live Blog</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4284532\">5 Ways Google's Android Beats the iPhone (and 5 Ways It Doesn't)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4284279\">Google Picks Big Android Fight With T-Mobile G1 Phone: Live Analysis (With Hands-on Review &amp;

Whatever your reason, finding a truly \"natural\" product can be tricky.</p>\n<p>\"The FDA doesn't provide guidance on natural personal-care products, be they toothpaste or mascara, and there is no legal or medical definition of 'natural,' either,\" says New York City dermatologist Anne Chapas, M.D. Consumers will have more help if the Cosmetics Safety Act, currently under congressional review, becomes law; it will \"mandate that the FDA regulate chemicals in cosmetic products, as it does in drugs and food,\" says Dr. Chapas. In the meantime &#151; and it may be a long meantime &#151; it's up to you to figure out which synthetic ingredients you want to avoid.</p>\n<p>To help you decide, <em>Good Housekeeping</em> surveyed 900-plus readers to find out which synthetic ingredients topped their list of concerns. Then we asked experts to weigh in on which are simply annoying (for example, merely skin-irritating) and which may lead to more serious trouble (endocrine problems, or even cancer). Unfortunately, because research in humans tends to be scant, the risks in many cases are not well-known.

Landschoot, the director of the Center for Turfgrass Science at Penn State, sounds like a philosophy professor. \"There is no perfect lawn,\" Landschoot says. \"It depends on the user's expectations, the lawn's environment, and the owner's sense of aesthetics and lifestyle. It's personal.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nNonetheless, there remains a committed breed of homeowner eager to give perfection a try. Take David Cira, a 32-year-old paramedic with the New York City Fire Department. He grew up in a condo in Queens but spent countless happy weekends at his grandfather's home nearby, where the lawn was always just so. \"Nothing thrilled me more than mowing the lawn and helping in the garden,\" Cira says. \"I was good at it from an early age, and it was a passion I never got away from.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nToday, Cira maintains his parents' pristine lawn in Mineola, N.Y. He has taught summer adult education classes on turf care, and he has consulted for a landscape designer. To his friends and neighbors, he's an oracle of lawn wisdom. \"With a beautiful lawn, you get more out than you could ever put in,\" he says.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps you've loved your grass but it hasn't loved you back. We understand. We've been there. Lawn enthusiasts like Cira and Landschoot know it's a year-round relationship, not just a summer fling. That's why we worked with them to develop a four-season guide to the perfect lawn.","slide_title":"","custom_slide_links":[{"slide_links":[{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":1,"link_url":"","link_thumb_url":"","link_title":"","link_text":""}],"__total_count__":1,"link_heading":""}],"slide_credit":"Chris

you hear that a close friend is divorcing, you want to be nothing but supportive. But when you combine the delicate subject matter with your own mixed feelings (<em>Is she making the right choice? Is my marriage in trouble, too?</em>), it&#146;s easy to end up blurting out the wrong thing. You may mean<em> </em>to say, &#147;I&#146;m worried for you,&#148; but you end up<em> </em>saying, &#147;How will you take care of your family now?&#148; &#147;Friends try to be helpful, but their own fears and biases can make their comments backfire,&#148; says Monique Honaman, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/High-Road-Has-Less-Traffic/dp/0615375340\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The High Road Has Less Traffic: Honest Advice on the Path through Love and Divorce</em></a>. Here, eight things you should avoid saying to a divorcing friend, plus helpful words you should offer up instead.&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;I knew it would happen eventually!&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>This comment, along with the ever-popular &#147;You know, I never really liked him,&#148; comes across as pessimistic, and worse, dismissive of your friend&#146;s entire marriage, says Lisa Rene Reynolds, PhD, marital therapist and author of <a href=\"http://www.drlisarenereynolds.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Parenting Through Divorce: Helping Your Kids Thrive During and After the Split</em></a>. &#147;She might think, &#145;Why didn&#146;t you tell me?&#146;&#148; Your friend may even suspect that you&#146;ve never trusted her decisions<strong>. </strong>Not only that, but when you say anything like &#147;I knew it,&#148; you&#146;re implying that you<em> </em>understand more than she<em> </em>does about her own relationship&#150;&#150;which is a major insult, says Dr. Reynolds. Instead,<strong> </strong>if you mean &#147;I&#146;m on your<em> </em>side,&#148; say precisely that, says Honaman. That will keep the focus on her. You might also ask what you can do to help, such as offering to find a good therapist or attorney or taking her out for a drink so she can vent.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>&#147;But he seemed like such a nice guy!&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>Or<strong>, </strong>as Maria* heard from a friend after her divorce, &#147;I feel sorry for your ex-husband.&#148; While Maria knows that her friend didn&#146;t mean anything cruel, it took her aback. That&#146;s because a statement like this, again, can sound like you think you know more about the marriage than your friend does&#151;and worse, that you&#146;re taking his side. Remember, even if they seemed like the perfect couple, or he seemed like a top-notch spouse, outsiders (which includes you!) never know the whole story. If you feel badly for her ex, don&#146;t lead with that. You might instead say, &#147;I&#146;m sad for both of you,&#148; but keep the focus on her, says Dr. Reynolds. It&#146;s fine to be supportive of the guy, especially if you&#146;re close to them both. Just express your support separately and keep it neutral. Stick to statements like, &#147;I&#146;m sorry you&#146;re going through this.&#148;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#147;I don&#146;t believe in divorce,&#148; or &#147;Did you try hard enough?&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>Christine* got this gut-punch from a friend when she and her husband split. &#147;It made me feel as though I hadn&#146;t been devoted to my marriage, or hadn&#146;t made a big enough effort, which wasn&#146;t true,&#148; she says. And though you may think you&#146;re helping your friend weigh all of her options, there&#146;s almost no way to read this type of comment as anything other than judgmental, says Honaman. &#147;You&#146;re foisting your own value system on your friend, which is insulting.&#148; What if the divorce wasn&#146;t her idea, it was an abusive relationship or she tried&#150;&#150;but failed&#150;&#150;to get her husband into couples therapy?<strong> </strong>Often, your own fear of divorce is behind comments like these, says Honaman. &#147;It might be your way of saying, &#145;It won&#146;t happen to us because we don&#146;t believe in it!&#146; or &#145;We&#146;ll keep trying.&#146;&#148; The only thing you can say instead is&#133;nothing. Seriously, keep it to yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#147;How are you going to take care of your family <em>now</em>?&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>Margaret,* a divorced mother of four, heard a variation on this from friends. &#147;One said, &#145;You can&#146;t complain that it&#146;s hard to be a single parent because you asked for this.&#146;&#148; What stings here is that you&#146;re saying your friend isn&#146;t &#147;competent enough to go it alone,&#148; explains Dr. Reynolds. &#147;Your friend is likely already worried about supporting her family,&#148; she adds. It&#146;s better to reframe your concerns in a softer way, says Honaman. Try: &#147;Have you thought about the house? Will you be able to stay home with the kids, or do you need help finding a higher-paying job?&#148; Be solution-oriented, and if you can, pitch in by babysitting her kids or revamping her resume.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#147;You ruined our annual holiday celebration!&#148;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The truth is, divorce doesn&#146;t just pull apart spouses; it changes relationships with friends (like the other couples with whom you rented a ski house) and family dynamics (think complicated holiday schedules with grandparents). Still, this comment comes across as selfish, says Honaman. It&#146;s not like she should stay with her husband solely to keep your social life unruffled! It&#146;s fine to let her know that you&#146;re sad, too, but don&#146;t make her break-up about your woes. Instead, express willingness to be flexible. Say something like, &#147;I guess we&#146;ll have to figure out what we&#146;re doing about our usual New Year&#146;s bash, huh?&#148; suggests Dr. Reynolds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#147;Good for you; men are useless anyway!&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>One of Helen&#146;s* friends said exactly that, bitterly suggesting that<strong> </strong>they throw themselves a man-bashing party. &#147;It was shocking. I wasn&#146;t happy with my ex, but I don&#146;t hate all men!&#148; You may think a comment like this sounds sisterly and supportive, or even funny, but it may strike your friend&#150;&#150;who could be feeling hopeful about her romantic future&#150;&#150;as unbearably negative. If you&#146;re in a bad place in your own romantic life, keep that part under wraps for now, and simply tell her, &#147;Listen, I&#146;ve been out there for a while. Maybe the two of us could lean on each other.&#148; Expressing support is better than infecting her with anger, says Dr. Reynolds.&#160;</p>\n<p><br /> <strong>&#147;It'll be tough to start over at your age.&#148;</strong></p>\n\n<p>While you may be trying to come across as understanding, this statement sounds like you think your friend has missed her moment and that no one wants to date an &#147;old&#148; divorc&#233;e like her. What&#146;s likely going on is that you&#146;re worried for your friend&#150;&#150;and possibly yourself too. People tend to impose their own fears on outside situations: &#147;What if it were <em>me </em>having to start all over again?!&#148; But the last thing you want to do is be a downer or invoke panic in your friend, says Dr. Reynolds.<strong> </strong>There <em>is </em>a way to express your concerns tactfully&#150;&#150;but only if she brings up the topic herself, says Dr. Reynolds. &#147;You can say, &#145;It might be tough, but if you want to find a new relationship, I know you can.&#146;&#148; </p>\n<p><strong>&#147;At least you didn't have kids!&#148; </strong></p>\n\n<p>Sally* heard this from friends&#150;&#150;and it stung. &#147;It&#146;s like they were saying that my divorce was &#145;easier.&#146; Plus, the statement made me feel like more of a failure because we weren&#146;t married long enough for children to be an issue.&#148; Though you&#146;re probably trying to put a positive spin on a bad situation, says Honaman, you&#146;re off the mark for two reasons. One, her divorce is undoubtedly painful to her<em>, </em>kids or no kids. And two, &#147;You may be opening up a whole other wound if your friend had wanted kids and didn&#146;t have them before her marriage ended,&#148; says Dr. Reynolds. &#147;Acknowledge her feelings, and later, if she seems ready, you can help her see the benefit of not having to deal with custody and co-parenting battles,&#148; says Honaman. But in the moment, keep it to yourself.</p>\n\n<p> *Names have been changed. </p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-23T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"938870","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/mz/woman-talking-coffee-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Schipani","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6649696","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-23T20:16:40.000Z","author_id":"12613","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/dating-marriage/8-things-never-say-divorcing-friend","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"At the dawn of the automotive industry, carmakers were already tinkering with hybrid designs.

Ferdinand Porsche built the Lohner-Porsche series hybrid car back in 1901. It used a gas engine to spin a generator that fed electricity to in-wheel motors. In 1917, the Woods Motor Vehicle Company of Chicago offered the Woods Dual Power, a series hybrid that could motor along&#151;at speeds of less than 15 mph&#151;solely on battery power. But I think the 1916 Owen Magnetic might be the most interesting early hybrid of them all.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Owen Magnetic's technological leap was its electromagnetic transmission. Invented by the wonderfully named Justus B. Entz, an electrical engineer from New York who once worked with Thomas Edison, the electromagnetic transmission compactly housed both a 24-volt generator and an electric traction motor. The crankshaft of a 75-hp gas engine was attached to the generator, which sent juice to the traction motor, which in turn powered the rear wheels. There was no mechanical connection between the engine and the drivetrain.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOne could argue that in 1916 hybrids made even more sense than they do today because early manual transmissions were such a bear to operate. Most cars of the era had straight-cut gears and heavy clutches. If you were a man or a woman with a bad leg, or you simply weren't able to drive, shift, and double-clutch at the same time, the Owen Magnetic was the perfect vehicle, since it has no clutch or gear shifter. To go faster, you press on the gas and then move a steering-wheel-mounted lever along six speed detents. As you accelerate, the engine speed increases, and that in turn speeds up the generator, enhancing power. Each successive lever position increases the intensity of the motor's magnetic field and torque. Compared with operating most early cars, driving the Owen Magnetic is a breeze.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe car's other advantage was its electric brake. There's a cockpit lever that turns the traction motor&#151;the one that drives the rear wheels&#151;into a generator. So when it's time to slow down, you move the lever, and the resistance provided by the motor slows the car and charges the batteries&#151;the same kind of regenerative mode that's found in today's hybrids. A lot of my old cars, which weigh between 3000 and 4000 pounds, have only rear brakes. Consequently, those brakes produce a lot of heat. When you go down a long hill, you can smell 'em starting to burn up, and they quickly fade. And if an early car's brakes get wet, oh boy, you're in for a panic. But with the Owen Magnetic, you rarely have to get on the brakes unless you need to stop completely, like at a stop sign. If you're going 35 to 40 mph, you engage \"regen\" and you coast, or freewheel. As soon as you hit 25 mph, you feel the transmission go <i>eeehhhhrrr!</i> And the car slows right down to 3 or 4 mph. Plus, you can watch gauges that show the batteries charging.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMy Owen Magnetic was originally sold straight from the floor of the 1916 New York Automobile Show and shipped to the buyer's home in Norway. He must have forgotten that there weren't many roads in Norway in 1916. That's probably why my car has less than 9000 miles on it.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nI'm not sure when the car made it back to America, but it was probably in the 1970s. I found it right here in Los Angeles. Whatever you're looking for, you can find it within 50 miles of L.A. During World War I, and even more so during World War II, plenty of defense contractors were on the West Coast&#151;Lockheed, Boeing, Douglas, and many more. Engineers and other technically minded people were drawn here. With the great climate, cars didn't rust and people didn't throw anything away. A lot of the interesting cars and stuff just stayed in the area.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSo why did the Owen Magnetic company fail in 1922, after producing just 700 cars?\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe ads called it the car of a thou-sand speeds. But as is sometimes the case, being better isn't always enough. The car had to be competitively priced. A 1917 Ford Model T cost $360; Cadillacs ran about two grand. An Owen Magnetic started at $3700 and went up from there.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAnother problem was the complicated relay-and-wiring shift mechanism. It's mounted under the hood alongside the steering column. I haven't opened mine up because it seems to work fine. And, quite frankly, I'm frightened to poke around in there. A plate on it says, \"If something goes wrong, do not attempt to work on this yourself. Send it back to the factory.\" Who would want a car that a blacksmith couldn't fix?\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn that era, most people didn't care that much about new technology. It's like the full hybrids today. They're still a hard sell because they cost more than other cars in their class. You can get better mileage, but that initial cost penalty keeps many people from buying them.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWith cars, simpler and cheaper parts are often better. When the Mustang was developed, Ford considered a more expensive independent rear suspension than the solid axle the car came with. As legend has it, Ford executive Lee Iacocca said, \"Americans don't give a crap about that. Make it inexpensive; make it look sexy. Don't put something in it they can't see.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nCompanies that don't make it in the car business usually fail because they try to sell a product that's too good or they over-engineer it and put in more than people want or need.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSadly, that's what happened with the Owen Magnetic. \n\n<br /><br

His parents were supportive of his hobby, but one member of the household wasn't so thrilled. \"I'd make the rovers chase after my cat,\" Bunting says. \"It would hide, so I had to make a robot to invade its privacy!\" His robots became more sophisticated, and when he got to the University of Arizona, he built a hexapod with artificial intelligence. Bunting's professor offered him a job in the Robotics and Neural Systems Lab, where the 25-year-old now creates robots inspired by biology. \"I knew that this was what I wanted to do, and now I'm doing it,\" he says. \"It's incredible.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Vz/my-job-roboticist-0412-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 14pt\">Projects</h3><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">1. Hexapod</h3><br />\n\nWhen Bunting built this bot in 2009, it had no programmed knowledge of its own geometry. It used a camera to teach itself how to walk over four days. Now Bunting uses the device for research on machine learning. \"I'm exploring behaviors using only the camera&#151;no fancy sensors,\" he says. In one experiment, Bunting gave the robot a genetic algorithm that mimicked evolution, allowing it to learn how to walk with \"this very eerie, natural motion,\" he says. \"And that only took 10 seconds.\" For another, the hexapod built a 3D map of the surrounding terrain and stepped over obstacles.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 11pt\">2. Cheetah</h3><br />\n\nTo construct a robotic cheetah for a DARPA project, Bunting and his colleagues built a pair of pneumatically powered legs with simulated feet and toes. Most robots that run have springs in their feet. But the goal here isn't just speed. \"If we wanted to build the fastest land robot, we'd make a wheeled machine,\" Bunting says. \"Our constraint is to learn how biology solved a problem. It's hard to make a fully articulated limb that hits the ground all the time. It wears parts out.\" In the future, this work will help others make more durable robots and prosthetics.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Open Format Article","publish_date":"2012-04-20T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11119","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"McCarthy","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"ndantuono","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6705756","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/outdoors/extreme-jobs/roboticist-this-is-my-job-6705756\">Roboticist : This Is My Job </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4204007\">Resident Roboticist : Living in a Robot Ecosystem</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4341854\">The Coming (Cleaning) Robot War</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/4341726\">22 Top Products at CES 2010: Evolution Robotics Mint Cleaning Robot</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/robots/4208628\">Top 5 Robots You Can Buy Right Now</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/4211938\">Top 5 Robots that Own YOU: Resident Roboticist </a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/evolution-robotics-mint-cleaning-robot-at-ces-2010-video-62769184001\">Evolution Robotics Mint Cleaning Robot at CES 2010 Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/robots/anatomy-of-a-robot-claw-first-robotics-2011\">Anatomy of a Robot Claw: FIRST Robotics 2011</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4313889\">FIRST Robotics Competition 2009 World Championship: PM Reports on the Winning Team from the Georgia Dome</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/robots/4215924\">The Brain-Powered Robot Servant: Resident Roboticist </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"10","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:18:39.000Z","author_id":"5680","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/extreme-jobs/roboticist-this-is-my-job-6705756","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"DVD, VHS, even projector film&#151;wherever you've stored those old home movies of long-ago vacations or children's first steps, you could lose them if the physical medium deteriorates.

As film and video media get old, they fall apart. This is the paradox at the center of our movie collections: It's the priceless images&#151;the first steps, the trips down the aisle&#151;that have greatest risk of loss. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nReel-to-reel 8-mm tape has a typical shelf life of about 20 years, at which point the threat of magnetic instability, tape deformation, and general chemical breakdown becomes unavoidable. Likewise, VHS cartridges begin to deteriorate after only a decade. Recordable CDs and DVDs, despite their apparent durability, can fall prey to oxidation after just a few years&#151;data is stored on a delicate metal film at the top of the disc, not in the plastic. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nHard drives and solid-state storage won't last forever either, but at least they give you control. With your movie collection stored on a computer, it joins a maintainable mass of data, part of your ongoing computing experience. Once in the digital realm, movies can be copied and recopied. They can be uploaded to the cloud. Most importantly, they can be backed up. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>From the Attic to the Hard Drive</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Before you get started digitizing</strong></span>, you'll need to assess the scale of your project. Digitizing tape or film is a real-time process; it takes as long to convert it as it does to watch it. Digitally archiving more than a dozen hour-long videotapes or more than a few reels of 8-mm film is a big undertaking, so if you're facing boxes and boxes full of dusty film, you might need to get professional help. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nServices such as DigMyPics and Digital Memories will digitize a variety of film and videotape formats, including 8-mm, for a rate of about $20 per transfer. This can quickly get expensive, but you're paying for more than just speed and ease&#151;these companies are well-equipped to deal with delicate, volatile old media. They also have well-maintained playback and recording equipment designed to tolerate imperfection and deal gracefully with failure. DigMyPics, for example, scans each reel frame by frame, projecting light through the film and onto a specially designed image sensor, ensuring consistent transfer quality. So if your home videos are both old and priceless and you haven't viewed them in years, you should err on the side of caution; not only are your reels and cassettes weakened by age, but your vintage playback hardware probably isn't at its best either. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThat's not to say you can't digitize tape and film yourself. If you know your home movies to be in decent shape and your playback hardware is in working order, digitizing personal video is a uniquely gratifying personal project. Think of it less as a chore than as a chance to revisit your life's greatest stories. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Video Playback 101</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>You don't spend hours converting old videos</strong></span> just to leave them languishing on a hard drive.

From atop his wind-swept perch, the CEO of the Mojave Air and Space Port surveys a fleet of graders and other heavy equipment churning up 19 acres of dirt beneath a blue desert sky.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAt the moment, it's just a sprawling construction site, but within two years, work will be completed on a pair of hulking buildings. One will be a fabrication facility for the world's biggest airplane. The other will be the hangar that houses it. \"You're looking at something that's going to be fundamentally breathtaking,\" Witt says.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe official name of the mammoth aircraft is Model 351, but it already has a nickname: the Roc, after the mythological bird big enough to carry away elephants for dinner. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe record-breaking plane, which will have six engines and twin fuselages, is being built to carry a rocket to 30,000 feet. From there, the rocket will drop from the plane and blast into space. The first payloads will consist of satellites and other cargo, but the program's backers say the rocket will eventually carry passengers. The Roc will be a flying launchpad&#151;government and private-sector customers welcome. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIncredibly, the project has been in development for more than eight years under total secrecy. Then, this past December, billionaire Paul Allen announced his Stratolaunch project to the world at a press conference in Seattle. When the space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011, the United States lost its only way to get astronauts off the planet. Stratolaunch is the latest private-sector initiative to try to fill that void. \"For the first time since John Glenn, America cannot fly its own astronauts into space,\" Allen said in Seattle. \"Stratolaunch will build an air-launch system to give us orbital access to space with greater safety, flexibility, and cost effectiveness, both for cargo and manned missions.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn the process, the Stratolaunch team hopes to build a new American spaceflight industry. But there are more than government contracts at stake: When the cost of launches decreases, more industry satellites, tourists, and science projects will reach orbit. Space will truly be open to the public. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nTo reach that lofty goal, Allen has assembled a team of mavericks from the private space industry to make Model 351 into flight-ready hardware. Scaled Composites, a Mojave-based firm founded by designer (and <em>Popular Mechanics</em> Breakthrough Award winner) Burt Rutan, will make the airplane. \"To allow public access to orbit, we need to increase safety by a factor of 100,\" Rutan, who sits on the Stratolaunch board of directors, says. \"I think airborne launch will be a significant part of the safety solution.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe rocket will also be made to order. For that, Allen approached PayPal co-creator Elon Musk, who founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). Building a two-stage rocket that will be dropped from an airplane is the kind of bold challenge that SpaceX was created to tackle, but hitting the specifications for mass, center of gravity, and other technical details will be tricky. \"We're in what I call the rocket-design box,\" Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president, says, \"where we can be only so long and weigh only so much but still need to get a specific amount of payload to orbit. Piece of cake.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Launching Spacecraft From Airplanes: A Brief History</strong></h3><br />\n\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/launching-spacecraft-from-airplanes-a-brief-history\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/e1/air-launch-495x170-041712.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Launching Spacecraft From Airplanes\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Flight of the Roc</strong></h3><br />\n\nIn 2015, hangar doors wider than the length of a football field will slide open. The 600-ton Stratolaunch mother ship will lumber directly onto Mojave's Runway 30, which extends 12,500 feet through the desert scrub toward the windmills churning the air in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains. The Roc's gleaming white, 385-foot wings will cast long, slender shadows as the plane moves into the bright California sun.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhen air traffic controllers clear the Roc for takeoff, its crew will throttle up six Pratt & Whitney 4056 turbofan jet engines, each of which generates about 60,000 pounds of thrust. The high-pitched turbine whine of a four-engine 747 reaches 140 decibels during takeoff. That's 20 decibels above the pain threshold&#151;and the Stratolaunch vehicle will have two additional engines. The shriek of the Roc on takeoff will echo for miles&#151;one good reason to base its development in the empty desert at Mojave. Accelerating down the runway will put some flexion into the wings, likely giving them a bit of a flapping quality as the plane takes off.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMojave will host test flights. Paid space launches, scheduled to begin in 2020, will depart from Cape Canaveral, Fla. There the aircraft will carry a 120-foot rocket mounted to the bottom of the spar connecting the fuselages. The sight will be dramatic&#151;an airplane with a wingspan greater than the length of a football field, carrying a rocket with wisps of vapor escaping from its cryogenic liquid oxygen tanks. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAllen envisions the system one day delivering as many as six people per flight into space. The passengers will buckle into seats inside a capsule at the rocket's tip. Assuming the capsule has windows, these paying customers will be treated to views of the receding Florida coastline and, after a steady climb, the curvature of Earth.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAnd then it gets exciting. Once at 30,000 feet, the Roc's crew will start a brief countdown and flip the sequence of switches that releases the rocket. The Roc's pilots will then veer away sharply to stay clear of the rocket's flight path. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDuring the drop, the rocket's fins will pitch the rocket at a steep angle for its impending climb to space. The capsule passengers' orientation will shift: Imagine tipping over your chair, and that brief but gut-wrenching free-fall. And then imagine being slammed back into your seat by g-forces as the rocket's engines ignite, expelling a half-million pounds of thrust. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOnce in space, 298,000 feet above the release point, the rocket will drop the first stage, and the second will fire, flinging the capsule (or 13,500 pounds of payload) the rest of the way into orbit.

In what other situation would people feel comfortable telling a woman, &#147;You look heavy&#148; or &#147;Aren&#146;t you a little old for that&#148;? If you&#146;d rather not press a pregnant woman&#146;s buttons, consider these tips from <a href=\"http://mommydocs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Mommy Docs</a>, a trio of ob-gyns who star in the television series <em>Deliver Me</em>, who have witnessed 15,000 deliveries and have six children between them. Yvonne Bohn, MD, Alane Park, MD, and Allison Hill, MD, also penned <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mommy-Ultimate-Guide-Pregnancy-Birth/dp/B006CDD8FS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1327476079&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Mommy Docs' Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and Birth</em></a>, so they know their way around a mother-to-be&#146;s body and<em> </em>mind. Read on to see common ways that people inadvertently offend expecting moms, plus things they&#146;d prefer to hear instead.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Are you sure you're not having twins?&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;Every inch of me looked pregnant from six months on,&#148; says Sarah, a mother of one. &#147;So relatives would ask, &#145;Are you sure there aren&#146;t two in there?&#146; or say &#145;You look like you're about to pop!&#146;&#148; You wouldn&#146;t mention extra pounds to someone who wasn&#146;t pregnant, so why is the weight of a woman who&#146;s expecting fair game? It&#146;s not. &#147;Women gain different amounts of weight in their pregnancies,&#148; says Dr. Bohn. And pregnant women can be especially sensitive about added pounds, especially if they&#146;re already not feeling particularly attractive. If you feel compelled to comment about a pregnant woman&#146;s appearance, stick with something positive and vague, such as, &#147;You look great!&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;You're so tiny&#151;you can barely tell you&#146;re pregnant! That can't be healthy.&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>&#147;I carried all in the front for both pregnancies,&#148; says Nicole, a mother of two. &#147;People thought they were paying me a compliment by asking, &#145;Are you eating enough?&#146; But really, they were making me second-guess my weight, which, according to my doctor, was fine.&#148; Again, pregnant women gain different amounts of weight, and every woman carries that weight differently. A mom-to-be who seems small to you could be perfectly healthy&#151;and she&#146;s probably sick of people trying to force-feed her. &#147;Only a woman&#146;s doctor can advise her on what&#146;s healthy for her and her baby,&#148; says Dr. Bohn. Even if you&#146;re trying to make a pregnant woman feel good about herself, skip comments about her weight gain&#151;or lack thereof.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Are you disappointed it's not a girl?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Nicole also got frustrated when people would say, \"It's your second baby? You must be trying for a boy!\" or ask \"Are you upset it&#146;s not another girl?\"<strong> </strong>Given how awesome a pair of sisters (Venus and Serena Williams) or a bunch of boys (the Jonas brothers!) can be, it&#146;s strange to assume parents want a boy-girl set&#151;or prefer a child of one sex over the other. &#147;It boggles my mind when people say stuff like this,&#148; says Dr. Park. &#147;Most of our patients just want a healthy baby!&#148; The only assumption you can make about a woman who&#146;s having a second or third baby is that she wants another <em>child</em>. Period.</p>\n<p><strong>\"You're going to breastfeed, right?\"</strong></p>\n<p>School-teacher Beth, a mother of two, couldn&#146;t stand people prying about her feeding plans. &#147;My mom friends would ask if I was breastfeeding. I did, but only for eight weeks. There&#146;s no time to pump in the three-minute break between classes&#151;and I hated having to justify my decision.&#148;<strong> </strong>From a health standpoint, breast is best because breast milk may protect against infections and diseases, prevent a baby from developing allergies and more. But whether or not a woman breastfeeds is a personal decision that needs no explanation. Plus, Dr. Park points out, there are circumstances (like demanding jobs) and health conditions (like not being able to produce enough breast milk) that make it difficult for a mom to breastfeed. And no woman&#151;pregnant or otherwise&#151;should feel obligated to share her medical files or personal history to defend her actions. &#147;Resist the urge to give advice on breastfeeding,&#148; urges Dr. Park. Unless, of course, you&#146;re asked. Even then, fight the compulsion to impose your beliefs on someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Oh, you're wide! You're definitely having a girl!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;A daughter steals her mother's beauty,&#148; Sarah&#146;s grandmother announced. And the mailman&#151;yes, mailman!&#151;decided Sarah was wide for an expecting woman, and declared she was having a girl. Sarah survived comments from the peanut gallery&#151;and gave birth to a healthy son. Despite the countless myths and wise old women in the grocery store, &#147;there&#146;s no<em> </em>proven method to predict whether a woman is carrying a boy or a girl based on the mother-to-be&#146;s physical appearance,&#148; confirms Dr. Hill. Besides, what feels like good fun and guessing games to you might feel an awful lot like an insult to the woman you&#146;re passively calling unattractive or fat.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;I was back in my skinny jeans a week after giving birth.&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>That&#146;s what a neighbor told Beth when she was a week past her due date and feeling the opposite of skinny. Seeing celebrity moms looking gorgeous on the red carpet two minutes after having a baby is enough to make any mortal new mom want to run for cover. So don&#146;t add to the pressure by bragging about your own fabulous post-baby body. &#147;What worked for you might not work for another woman,&#148; says Dr. Hill. For example, even though breastfeeding burns hundreds of calories, not every mom will drop pounds by nursing alone. &#147;If you want to be supportive, avoid making comparisons,&#148; adds Dr. Hill.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;I hope the baby gets your nose!&#148;</strong></p>\n<p>&#147;My mother-in-law loved to say this,&#148; says Nicole. &#147;But what if my child didn&#146;t get my nose? Would I love him less? And did she love my husband less because of his large-ish nose?&#148; You might think you&#146;re complimenting an expectant mom here, but she could take those words as, &#147;Jeez, your husband&#146;s nose is big,&#148; says Dr. Bohn. New parents are going to think their baby is gorgeous, even if the child arrives with Uncle Charlie&#146;s bushy eyebrows. Instead of speculating about the baby&#146;s looks, try something like, &#147;New babies are the sweetest. I bet you can&#146;t wait to meet her!&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Did you see that show about the baby with [insert horrible disease here]?&#148; </strong></p>\n<p>Beth shared a classroom with a teacher who loved to tell doomsday scenarios, always asking if she&#146;d heard about that baby who had suffered from x, y or z. Or she&#146;d share gems like this: &#147;My boss&#146;s wife&#146;s second cousin's former roommate died in labor! But you'll be fine!&#148; Any mom who&#146;s cracked open her baby books knows there&#146;s plenty that can go wrong in nine months and beyond. You don&#146;t need to add to her fears by sharing horror stories&#151;especially those you heard through the grapevine or on the Lifetime channel. &#147;Moms worry enough on their own,&#148; says Dr. Hill. Rather than adding to the stress, save your &#147;Did you hear about the&#133;?&#148; stories for someone who&#146;s not expecting and share happy stories or ask what the mom-to-be is most excited about.</p>\n<p><em></em><strong>&#147;That must've been a surprise!&#148;</strong><em></em></p>\n<p>When Nicole got pregnant at 23 on her honeymoon, people assumed the pregnancy was a mistake. (It wasn&#146;t!) &#147;Did you plan to get pregnant so soon?&#148; a friend asked, and &#147;That must've been a surprise!&#148; a co-worker said with a wink.<strong> </strong>&#147;The timing of a woman&#146;s pregnancy is none of your business,&#148; says Dr. Park. What seems &#147;so soon&#148; to you might be exactly the time the expecting parents intended to get pregnant. And even if the pregnancy wasn&#146;t planned, if the parents are embracing it, you should, too. When someone offers up pregnancy news, the best possible thing you can do is share her enthusiasm.</p>\n<p><strong>&#147;Aren't you too old to have a baby?&#148; </strong><em></em></p>\n<p>Conversely, Sarah, who got pregnant at 39, was constantly fielding questions related to waiting to have children, like, &#147;Did you make your baby the old-fashioned way?&#148; Once a woman&#146;s pregnant, it&#146;s not your concern how the bun got in the oven&#151;or whether the oven&#146;s a little on the older side. Like other expecting moms, older moms-to-be are probably doing plenty of fretting. (It&#146;s not news that pregnancy gets tougher with age!) &#147;And if they&#146;re not worried, it&#146;s not your job to scare them,&#148; says Dr. Hill. When an older friend announces her pregnancy, just offer her the same sincere congratulations you&#146;d give a younger one.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-16T17:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"943837","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/XW/pregnant-woman-holding-belly-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Fusaro","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6654241","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-16T21:12:18.000Z","author_id":"37817","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/friendship/10-things-never-to-say-to-a-pregnant-woman","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Discover chic ways to transition from cold to warmer weather","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"stacy london, spring fashion, what not to wear, what to wear in spring, spring fashion trends, spring fashions","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Stacy London&#146;s Spring Style Picks","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-16T21:13:10.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Woman's Day","source_id":"1","teaser":"Discover chic ways to transition from cold to warmer weather","origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":"Discover chic ways to transition from cold to warmer weather","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"Stacy London from What Not to Wear gives her top tips for spring fashion and how to stylishly transition from winter to spring.","url_name":"stacy-london-spring-style","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-02-15T17:28:52.000Z","title":"Stacy London&#146;s Spring Style Picks","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"What to Wear in Spring - Stacy London Fashion","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"818","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"egillin","last_name":"Staff","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-10-19T14:33:15.000Z","id":"11829","last_updated_date":"2011-10-19T14:33:30.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Woman's Day"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":[{"qa":[{"question":"What are your style essentials for the transition from winter to spring?","__total_count__":1,"sender":"","answer":"A bright coral or fuchsia top, like a button-front cotton shirt or silk blouse, is a lifesaver this time of year. On chillier days, layer it under a basic black, brown or gray cardigan. Come warmer weather, it can stand on its own. Another essential: tailored trousers that taper slightly at the ankle. The trim shape of these pants allows them to work equally well with chunky knit sweaters and boots or high-heeled sandals and a wispy top. Also, a floral shift or sheath dress is a good investment. The pattern is right on trend, and it can be worn alone or under a trim jacket when it's nippy."}],"intro_text":""}],"article_type_name":"Q & A","publish_date":"2012-04-16T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"947513","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/8I/stacy-london-pink-dress-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Staff","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"qanda","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6655683","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"7","last_updated_date":"2012-04-16T21:13:27.000Z","author_id":"11829","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-15T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/style-beauty/fashion-style/stacy-london-spring-style","issue_date":"Woman's Day; March 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Use UFC fighter Terry Etim's tips to blast out your Bastards and top our challenge leaderboard","site_id":"583","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"leaderboard, video, stamina, bastard, terry etim, facebook, challenge, endurance, bastard challenge","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"<em>MH</em> Bastard Challenge tips","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-06-14T08:09:23.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/bastard-challenge-tips","link_text":"Take the MH Bastard Challenge"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/blogs/terry-etim-ufc-interview","link_text":"Terry Etim Q+A"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/the-mens-health-bastard-challenge","link_text":"The Men's Health Bastard Challenge"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/ultimate-circuit-challenge","link_text":"The ultimate circuit challenge"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/the-challenge-is-alive","link_text":"The Challenge is alive!"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/Prepare-psychologically-for-endurance-events","link_text":"How to train psychologically for endurance events"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/building-muscle/up-for-a-real-challenge","link_text":"Up For A Real Challenge ?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/mens-health-pull-up-challenge","link_text":"The Men's Health 25 Pull-Up Challenge"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/building-muscle/boost-your-endurance","link_text":"15-minute endurance -boosting workout"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fitness/form-a-reebok-zigtech-challenge-mini-league-facebook","link_text":"Form a Reebok ZigTech Challenge mini-league"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"unknown","source_id":"641","teaser":"Use UFC fighter Terry Etim's tips to blast out your Bastards and top our challenge leaderboard","origin_site_id":"583","sub_heading":"Use UFC fighter Terry Etim's tips to blast out your Bastards and top our <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/challenges/the-mens-health-bastard-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">challenge leaderboard</a>\n\n","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"You have 60 seconds to repeat the world's toughest exercise as many times as you can.

The ship was the jewel of the industrial age. That such an extravagantly engineered behemoth could fall victim to the everyday risks of sailing the North Atlantic was more than shocking; it set off a period of deep skepticism about the relationship between man and his machines.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA series of inquests and reports laid out the reasons for the catastrophe and led to reforms in marine engineering and maritime law. But one risk factor couldn't be eliminated: human fallibility. In <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cm/popularmechanics/data/LessonsfromTitanic.pdf\">an article published in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> soon after the tragic event</a>, we noted that the <em>Titanic</em> \"simply furnished another example of the well-established principle that if, in the conduct of any enterprise, an error of human judgment or faulty working of the human senses involves disaster, sooner or later the disaster comes.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn one respect, little has changed. As the recent loss of the Italian cruise ship <em>Costa Concordia</em> demonstrates, bad decision making can overcome even robust engineering. Virtually all man-made disasters&#151;including the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the space shuttle <em>Challenger</em> explosion, and the BP oil spill&#151;can be traced to the same human failings that doomed <em>Titanic</em>. After 100 years, we must still remember&#151;and, too often, relearn&#151;the grim lessons of that night.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>No disaster is a single event.</strong></span> Complex systems rarely fail without warning. Instead, accidents are the product of decisions made over hours, days, and sometimes years. Those choices are shaped both by the culture of the organization&#151;whether it's NASA or the White Star Line, which owned <em>Titanic</em>&#151;and by outside pressures.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, the launch of the <em>Challenger</em> had already been postponed six times. Ever image conscious, NASA brass pushed to launch, despite the objections of engineers who worried that the rubber seals between segments of the vehicle's booster rockets might fail in the unusually cold temperatures. One of those engineers, Allan J. McDonald, recounts in his book <em>Truth, Lies and O-Rings: Inside the Space Shuttle </em>Challenger<em> Disaster</em> that small quantities of combustion gases had leaked through the seals on previous missions. It was a warning sign&#151;but NASA came to accept the leaks as normal. Engineers were forced into the impossible position of trying to convince officials that their worries were valid. \"'Is it safe to fly ' is the correct question,\" McDonald tells <em>Popular Mechanics</em>, \"not that you have to prove it will fail.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nLike the space shuttle, <em>Titanic</em> was the technological pinnacle of its day. But a series of decisions&#151;from carrying too few lifeboats to using a rudder that may have been too small to enable the ship to turn quickly&#151;pared its margin of error. Those risks were compounded by unsafe operation. Accounts differ on whether White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay urged Capt. Edward J. Smith to speed across the Atlantic in the hope of setting a record. But there's no question that the captain sailed the new and barely tested vessel through a region of known iceberg risk at nearly full speed on a moonless night. (A nearby ship, the SS <em>Californian, </em>had stopped for the night.) It was just one more bad decision along the <em>Titanic'</em>s doomed path.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Success can breed complacency.</strong></span> During a career of more than four decades, the <em>Titanic'</em>s Capt. Smith had been involved in only a single accident at sea, one that ended without loss of life. <em>The New York Times</em> noted that Smith's \"rise in rank and importance was commensurate with the safe uneventfulness of his command.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMajor disasters often occur after such long, uneventful stretches. Before the partial meltdown of the reactor at Three Mile Island in 1979, no U.S. nuclear plant had experienced a serious accident for 25 years. Similarly, before the blowout of the BP Macondo Prospect well in April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon rig had gone seven years without a serious mishap while drilling some of the deepest wells on the planet. \"When you think you have a robust system, you tend to relax,\" Henry Petroski, a professor of civil engineering at Duke University, tells <em>Popular Mechanics</em>. Over time BP and its contractors began to cut corners: Alarms that would have warned of a gas leak were silenced, safety checks canceled. The blowout preventer&#151;a last-ditch device intended to shut off a runaway well&#151;was only partly functional. And workers were constantly urged to drill faster. That kind of culture invites trouble. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Technology can outpace judgment.</strong></span> The construction of <em>Titanic</em> came at the apex of a remarkable period of innovation in shipbuilding. Well before the launch of <em>Titanic, </em>Capt. Smith expressed supreme confidence in the state of maritime engineering: \"I cannot imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder,\" he said in 1907. \"Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWith three powerful engines, <em>Titanic</em> could maintain high speeds day or night. But the crew's ability to spot hazards was little changed from the days of sail. Two men stood in a crow's-nest scanning the horizon&#151;they didn't even have binoculars. The ship was equipped with the latest communications innovation, wireless telegraph, and in the hours before the collision the ship received five warnings about icebergs from other vessels. But at the time, the telegraph was seen primarily as a luxury service for passengers, and the crew had no firm protocol for acting on the information. One message was handed to Ismay, who slipped it into his pocket, apparently unconcerned.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSimilarly, at the time of the Gulf of Mexico blowout, BP and its contractors were pushing the art of undersea drilling into ever-deeper waters, using increasingly sophisticated equipment. And yet the procedures to monitor and control these deep wells had not advanced much beyond those used in shallower seas.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Leaders may fail to plan for the worst.</strong></span> Just as Deepwater Horizon crews derived a false sense of confidence from their blowout preventer, the White Star Line put undue faith in the supposedly watertight compartments that composed <em>Titanic'</em>s lower decks. The compartments were not sealed at the top; if the ship's bow dipped low enough, seawater would flow from one compartment to the next like water filling an ice cube tray. The probability of that happening? Low. The consequences when it did? Catastrophic. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAnd so, the sinking of <em>Costa Concordia</em> feels sadly familiar. The ship was studded with technology&#151;what it lacked was good judgment by the people in charge. The captain approached too close to a rocky shore. Then, after the collision with an undersea outcrop, the crew rushed to reassure passengers that everything was fine. Had the crew quickly mustered everyone to the lifeboats instead, there might have been no loss of life. \"A tool is only as good as the person that's using it,\" says John Konrad, a U.S. Coast Guard master mariner and author. \"All the technology in the world can't replace a good captain.\" That remains as true in 2012 as it was a century ago.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-10T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Meigs","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"amoseman","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6705764","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/why-were-still-learning-the-lessons-of-titanic-6705764\">Why We're Still Learning the Lessons of Titanic </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/4217987\">World's Largest Cruise Ship Pulls 360s with Joystick</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/4-things-to-know-about-maritime-disasters-6640490\">4 Things to Know About Maritime Disasters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/planes-uavs/new-airborne-defense-against-small-swarming-boats-12175104\">New Airborne Defense Against Small Swarming Boats </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/what-if-a-cruise-ship-wrecked-in-alaska-6645471\">What if a Cruise Ship Wrecked in Alaska?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/recreation/boating/1277136\">7 Of The World's Fastest Fishing Boats </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/fleet-week-uss-iwo-jima\">Fleet Week Kicks Off with Parade of Ships </a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/4282360\">Building the World's Biggest Ship: Behind-the-Scenes First Look</a><br>\n<a href=\"/outdoors/survival/tips/how-to-survive-a-cruise-ship-disaster-9119032\">How to Survive a Cruise Ship Disaster </a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4313387\">Can you Build Ships Out of Ice?

While books about space exploration and robots once inspired young people to become scientists and engineers&#151;and inspired grownup engineers and scientists to do big things&#151;in recent decades the field has become dominated by escapist fantasies and depressing dystopias. That could be contributing to something that I see as a problem. It seems that too many technically savvy people, engineers in particular, are going to work for Web startups or investment firms. There's nothing wrong with such companies, but we also need engineers to design bold new things for use in the physical world: space colonies instead of social media.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIf I'm right, that's bad for all of us. But are we really losing the will to do big things or are the big things just different than they used to be? I asked around and, on this subject, found science-fiction writers to be pessimistic. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nOne of today's best SF authors is Neal Stephenson, whose books include <i>Cryptonomicon</i> and <i>The Diamond Age.</i> In a recent article in the <i>World Policy Journal,</i> he writes that during science fiction's so-called golden age&#151;roughly the late 1930s to the late 1960s&#151;the stories being published were about big things and big breakthroughs: moon rockets, Mars bases, robots, and teleportation. Perhaps by coincidence, those were times when the United States was actually doing big things and making big breakthroughs. Now, writes Stephenson, \"[s]peaking &#173;broadly, the techno-optimism of the Golden Age of SF has given way to fiction written in a darker, more skeptical, and ambiguous tone.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThose stories can be good&#151;some credit Stephenson's own 1992 book, <i>Snow Crash,</i> with anticipating the social media revolution&#151;but are they good for us? Or have we been focusing our imagination and efforts on things that are amusing but unimportant? Stephenson recently told <i>The New York Times,</i> \"We can't Facebook our way out of the current economic status quo.\" He is calling for new ways to expand civilization, not new forums for gossip.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nI called Stephenson and asked him to elaborate. \"There was some moment in the late '60s and '70s when people thought we had enough tech,\" he says. \"Technology was too dangerous, and people became reflexively skeptical of new ideas. If you stay that way for a couple of decades, it can come back to bite you. There's also a less obvious danger, which is that if science and technology stop wowing us, people start to develop skepticism about the scientific method.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/12-bold-optimistic-science-fiction-books\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/tI/bold-sci-fi-slideshow-495x170-040412.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"12 Bold Sci-Fi Books\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\nThat's a good point. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists could cite antibiotics, nuclear energy, and moon flights as evidence that science just plain worked. This gave them credibility on a range of issues. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nFacebook doesn't have the same impact&#151;it's fun, but even its users don't see it as an achievement on par with Apollo. Stephenson worries about that: \"We've had a lost generation of space geeks, who never really got the full brainwash.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut are things really that bad? I asked another eminent science-fiction author, Vernor Vinge (<i>A Fire Upon the Deep, The Children of the Sky</i>), to weigh in and, alas, he agreed. Science fiction, Vinge says, has become more escapist but less inspiring. He believes the real problem isn't to be found in science fiction, but in society. In particular, he argues that we've lost \"speed of implementation.\" We went from experimental jets to the F-104 in a decade, and to outer space in just 10 more years. Nowa&#173;days, we're not so fast, at least with high-visibility projects. (Just look at the bureaucratic inertia around replacing the space shuttle.)\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn my day job as a law professor, I tell my administrative law students the same thing. Not far from our campus in Knoxville is Norris Dam. The first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, it was generating electricity three years after the TVA Act passed Congress. If the TVA were created today, three years wouldn't even be enough time to produce the environmental impact statement. Sure, you can roll out a new social media platform or an iPhone app in a hurry, but do Twitter and Angry Birds improve lives the way rural electrification did? \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere is one solution on the horizon. If, as Vinge expects, we reach the Singularity&#151;a moment when artificial intelligences become more powerful than human brains&#151;in a few decades, \"we'll have far more imaginative creatures around,\" he says. So long as they're not Skynet. \n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/why-we-need-big-bold-science-fiction-6705760-2\">The State of Innovation >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/J9/sci-fi-dreams-02-0412-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-04T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Reynolds","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6705760","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/4256186\">The 10 Most Prophetic Sci-Fi Movies Ever</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4287442\">Scientists Debunk Personal Electromagnetic Fields on Fringe: Sci-Fi Fact vs. Fiction </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/why-we-need-big-bold-science-fiction-6705760\">Why We Need Big, Bold Science Fiction </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/4236920\">I Am Legend's Junk Science : Hollywood Sci-Fi vs. Reality</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/news/4259811\">Hollywood Sci-Fi's Bronze Age: Are Comics to Blame?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4303554\">Dollhouse's Memory Science Mixes Fact with Fiction </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/4342588\">Top 17 Science -Fiction -Themed Pinball Machines</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/the-100-best-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time\">The 100 Best Sci-Fi Movies of All Time</a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/4284506\">Fringe's Brain Science Flirts with Facts in 3rd Episode: Hollywood Fact vs. Fiction </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/4260687\">Debunking Lost's Science : Hollywood Sci-Fi Behind the Scenes</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:18:41.000Z","author_id":"5505","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/why-we-need-big-bold-science-fiction-6705760","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Learn what you can do now to hold onto more cash next year","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"tax returns, how to pay less taxes, 2012 taxes, filing taxes","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"10 Savvy Tax Moves for 2012","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-02T19:24:22.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/who-should-file-my-taxes-104726","link_text":"Who Should File My Taxes ?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/how-to-save-on-your-property-taxes-79839","link_text":"How to Save on Your Property Taxes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/5-free-easy-online-tax-tools-63503","link_text":"5 Free and Easy Online Tax Tools"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/10-common-tax-mistakes-to-avoid-66005","link_text":"10 Common Tax Mistakes to Avoid"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/must-have-tax-documents-checklist-103563","link_text":"Must-Have Tax Documents Checklist"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/15-celebrity-tax-evaders-105182","link_text":"15 Celebrity Tax Evaders"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/life/3-sites-for-tax-tools-103039","link_text":"3 Sites for&hellip;

The good news is that you&#146;ve still got loads of time in 2012 to make smart tax decisions, from stowing money in tax-deferred accounts to tracking expenses to selling things at the right time. Here&#146;s what the experts recommend.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjust your withholding.</strong></p>\n<p>Did you get a huge check back from last year&#146;s taxes? That&#146;s not as great a thing as you&#146;d think&#151;you&#146;re essentially making an interest-free loan to the government. &#147;Many people get large refunds because too much is subtracted from their salaries,&#148; says Julian Block, a tax attorney in Larchmont, NY. &#147;Some people do this to force them to save money, but most people do it because they don&#146;t know any better.&#148; Use the IRS&#146;s <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96196,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Withholding Calculator</a> to determine whether you should fill out a new W-4 form for your employer. Christi Lardy did this last year, after she bought a house in Portland, OR. &#147;Getting into the house cost more than I projected,&#148; she admits. &#147;I changed my withholding so I got more during the year to pay bills.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Max out your 401(k) contributions.</strong></p>\n<p>Want to save on taxes? The more money you put into tax-deferred accounts, like a 401(k), the less you&#146;ll have to pay Uncle Sam come April. At the very least, contribute enough to get your full employer match, if there is one. &#147;That&#146;s free money that your employer is giving you, so take advantage,&#148; suggests Craig Harris, manager of the national tax department for Liberty Tax Service.</p>\n<p><strong>Value your charitable donations.</strong></p>\n<p>The next time you drop off a bag of old clothes at your local Goodwill, catalogue its contents. &#147;And don&#146;t just guess at the value of the goods,&#148; says Fran Coet, a CPA in Westminster, CO.

It can be claimed for the first four full years of college education&#151;per student. If you or your children aren&#146;t eligible, you may instead be able to take the Lifetime Learning Credit, which can refund you up to $2,000 for qualified education expenses. If you think either credit applies to you, keep receipts and documentation for tuition, fees and required course materials. You can actually get a credit on your 2011 taxes if you paid tuition or other qualified expenses last year, as long as you have the right paperwork. Schools will typically send you a 1098-T tax form for tuition and fees paid, but receipts for books and other required materials are up to you to provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Check your state&#146;s 529 advantages.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#146;re socking money away for your kids&#146; college education, you might get a tax break for using your state&#146;s 529 savings plan. &#147;Most, but not all, states have a deduction if you contribute to the plan,&#148; says Mark Joseph, a financial planner in Reston, VA. &#147;You could get a couple thousand dollars in deductions on your state taxes.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>Time your foreclosure or short sale.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#146;re in dire housing straits and there&#146;s a foreclosure in your future, you may want to get it done in 2012. Ordinarily, when you have debt cancelled (such as the remaining balance on a mortgage), it&#146;s treated as taxable income, but the IRS is cutting taxpayers a break through the end of this year. &#147;No taxes will be levied on up to $2 million dollars for married taxpayers filing jointly, and up to $1 million for a married taxpayer filing a separate return,&#148; says Hewitt. Unless the government extends it, this benefit will expire in 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>Sell your winners.</strong></p>\n<p>This could be the year to offload long-term investments that have gone up in value. &#147;We have a very low capital gains rate now,&#148; says Jackie Perlman, principal analyst of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. &#147;But those rates are scheduled to shoot up in 2013.&#148; More specifically, you&#146;ll pay a maximum rate of 15% on long-term capital gains this year, but as much as 20% next year. And if you&#146;re in one of the bottom two tax brackets, your rate will go from 0% to 10%.</p>\n<p><strong>Track your job-searching expenses.</strong></p>\n<p>Save receipts from your job hunt in a safe place, because you may be able to deduct certain expenses. The requirements: You should be looking for a position in your current occupation, and there can&#146;t have been too much of a break since your last job. (So if you took a year off for school, say, you can&#146;t deduct the costs of your employment search afterward.) &#147;You can deduct expenses from traveling to and from interviews, staying in hotels, mailing resumes, making copies and hiring a headhunter,&#148; says Josh Barger, vice president of tax services for Foundation Financial Group in Jacksonville, FL. The catch: You can deduct only expenses that exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income. But if you&#146;re traveling heavily&#151;or are unemployed and not making much&#151;it may work. And if you move more than 50 miles away for a new job, keep receipts for mileage, movers and hotel costs. You don&#146;t even have to meet the 2% threshold to deduct them.</p>\n<p><strong>Choose home equity debt.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#146;re carrying a balance on a credit card or a car loan and you&#146;ve got equity in your home, consider taking out a home equity line of credit and using that to pay down your debt. &#147;You&#146;ll usually get a lower rate on the home equity line and the interest is tax deductible,&#148; says Joseph. &#147;It&#146;s a complete homerun.&#148; There are limits to the interest deduction based on the fair market value of your home and the balance on your mortgage&#151;check out <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p936.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">IRS Publication 936</a> for more details. And don&#146;t run up balances in the meantime; the idea is to lower your interest rate and pay off your debt, not to continue living above your means.</p>\n<p><strong>Use your flexible spending account (or sign up for one).</strong></p>\n<p>Many employers offer flexible spending accounts (FSAs) that allow you to use pre-tax money to pay for healthcare and childcare expenses. If you&#146;re participating this year, make sure you spend everything in it&#151;FSAs are use-it-or-lose-it accounts, so you&#146;ll be out any cash you didn&#146;t claim by December 31st (or March 15, 2013 at many companies). Even though FSAs are limited to prescription-only drugs&#151;no over-the-counter items without a doctor&#146;s note&#151;there are ways around this. &#147;I asked my acupuncturist to write a prescription for over-the-counter supplements so I could submit the expenses through my FSA,&#148; says Denise Winston of Bakersfield, CA. &#147;I just explained what I needed and asked her to do the paperwork. This nets a savings of about $400 per year.&#148; If you&#146;re not signed up, make sure you opt in for 2013 during your company&#146;s open enrollment period, which is usually in the fall. Benefits won&#146;t start until January 1, 2013, but then you can pay for up to $5,000 in childcare costs and $2,500 in medical costs with pre-tax cash.&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-04-02T15:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"951339","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/3o/jars-of-money-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Ashford","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6813990","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-04-02T19:24:34.000Z","author_id":"14019","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-22T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/life/saving-money/how-to-pay-less-taxes","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Discover everyday ways to sport this delicate, trendy style","site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"lace dresses, lace fabric, what to wear with a lace top, how to wear lace, lace tops","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"How to Wear Lace","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-02T19:25:42.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/craft-project-lace-spiderweb-123863","link_text":"Craft Project: Lace Spiderweb"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/gift-wrapping-how-to-paper-lace-flowers-107078","link_text":"Gift Wrapping How -To: Paper Lace and Flowers"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style-beauty/9-fall-runway-trends-you-should-try-123496","link_text":"9 Fall Runway Trends You Should Try"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/lace-edged-napkins-891","link_text":"Lace -Edged Napkins"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style-beauty/luxurious-lace-8-great-pj-picks-54372","link_text":"Luxurious Lace : 8 Great PJ Picks"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/craft-project-casablanca-corset-109209","link_text":"Craft Project: Casablanca Corset"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/wds-guide-to-making-clothes-last-115436","link_text":"WD&rsquo;s Guide to Making Clothes Last"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/5-closet-setbackssolved-123234","link_text":"5 Closet Setbacks&mdash;Solved"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/style-beauty/how-to-wear-springs-hottest-trends-116511","link_text":"How to Wear Spring's Hottest Trends"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/home/diy-style-kylara-crochet-vest-105962","link_text":"DIY Style: Kylara Crochet Vest"}],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Donna","source_id":"1","teaser":"Discover everyday ways to sport this delicate, trendy style","origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":"Discover everyday ways to sport this delicate, trendy style","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"See fashionable and flattering ways to wear lace.

over a decade ago, Julian Fellowes was a character actor who specialized in aristocrats.

Then, in 1999, he received a phone call asking if he'd be interested in writing a country house drama for Robert Altman. (Bob Balaban, who knew that Fellowes was a talented writer\nwho had yet to get a movie made, had recommended him.) The result: an Oscar for <i>Gosford Park</i>. Everything changed. Offers poured in. Fellowes wrote two best-selling novels and the book for the stage version of <i>Mary Poppins</i>, which became a global hit. And he dreamed up <i>Downton Abbey</i>. These days he is Lord Fellowes, having been made a life peer by the Conservative Party, which is ecstatic to have a thesp on board. On a rainy day in January, just before he will win a Golden Globe for <i>Downton Abbey</i>, we meet in the tea room in the Palace of Westminster, which happens to have been designed by Sir Charles Barry &#151; as was Highclere Castle, where the hit series is filmed. So charming, so benevolent is Fellowes, drinking tea and eating cucumber sandwiches in these magnificent Gothic Revival surroundings, that the good lord begins to merge with Lord Grantham in my mind. We could not even get to the tea room without his fellow peers enthusing about British television's most successful series in years. Lord Grade, former chairman of ITV and the BBC, stops Fellowes to say that he \"barely put his luggage down\" in his rush to watch the episode aired as a Christmas special on this side of the pond. But we are not really here to talk about that, delightful as it might be.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, in the desperate lull between seasons two and three, another Fellowes production will air. For the centennial of the most storied disaster in maritime history, Fellowes, 62, has written a four-part miniseries, <i>Titanic</i>, which will premiere on ABC on April 12. Many myths have clung to the wreckage of the \"unsinkable\" ship; more than 1,000 books, plays, and films have explored it in the hundred years since it went down, and even the first episode of <i>Downton Abbey</i> &#151; indeed, the plot of the entire series &#151; hinges on it. On the show there is upstairs and downstairs, two groups that operate separately but interact, and therein lies the tension. On the Titanic, Fellowes says, those two levels and everyone in between were represented: \"You have peeresses and showbiz stars and bankers and great figures of Broadway and the City, and then you have an enormous number of middle-class people traveling in second and working in the expanding markets of the world. You have immigrants who were longing for a new life, and you have the crew, from boilermen to officers. You have British, Americans, Irish, Canadians... It's a kind of world in miniature.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fellowes has a wonderfully subtle understanding of class drama. Educated at Ampleforth College and Cambridge, and married to Emma Kitchener (former lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent and, if she had been a boy, heir to the earldom of one of England's best-known military leaders, Lord Kitchener of Khartoum), Fellowes might seem the embodiment of the English toff. But he says it is both his closeness to that world and his distance from it that explain his ability to write about it. \"My father came from a very minor posh family, and my mother did not. So I grew up going to deb parties, but to her it was all quite amusing.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was pleased that <i>Titanic</i> finally afforded him the opportunity to also write about the middle class, who often get ignored in favor of the fringes. \"There is something decent about middle-class values that I endorse and believe in. They drove Edwardian England, just as they drive it today.\" Interestingly enough, he says, \"the highest percentage of deaths of any group on the ship was second-class men. They stood back and felt it was their duty to let others pass.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"What is extraordinary is the number of people who were just stoic, who stood around talking, smoking, and essentially waiting to die,\" Fellowes adds. \"J.J. Astor &#151; who had just caused a scandal by marrying, at 57, an 18-year-old, his second wife &#151; asked to accompany his wife into a lifeboat 'on account of her condition' and was turned down. He stepped back and handed his gloves to his pregnant bride to keep her warm.\"</p>\n<p>Fellowes had been haunted by the <i>Titanic</i> ever since he saw the 1958 film A Night to Remember as a schoolboy. To prepare to write his version, he read books, the reports of the New York and London hearings, and the accounts of passengers and crew. Then he used poetic license: Real characters have been mixed up with imaginary ones. \"I think you have a responsibility not to have real people say things they definitely wouldn't have said, or do things they wouldn't have done,\" he says. \"The point of this version &#151; which is not in competition with the Cameron movie, a wonderful film, a love story set in the context of the Titanic &#151; is an attempt to paint a portrait of life and what it was like on the ship.\" The challenge of <i>Titanic</i> is that everyone knows the ending. \"You could spend three episodes waiting for it to sink and have characters wandering around saying things like &#145;I love you' or &#145;I&#146;m going to divorce you when we get to New York.&#146; Or you can sink it every week\" &mash; the approach in his productio &#151; \"and you can show different parts of the ship, different characters, and by the end of the fourth episode you can know what they're all running to and what they're running from. All the stories gradually fall into place.\"</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining multiple story lines &#151; spinning many plates without ever losing control &#151; is a strategy Fellowes has used to titillating effect on <i>Downton Abbey</i>. It makes for fast-paced and satisfying viewing. He says he owes his success to Altman &#151; and not just because of that <i>Gosford Park</i> Oscar, but because of Altman's commitment to the multi-arc plot. \"I realized that single-narrative linear writing was much duller,\" Fellowes says. \"If you like irony, comedy, there is a lot of it when people are leading completely different lives in parts of the same building. So in the drawing room you can have a marriage collapsing and downstairs someone is learning the Charleston. And because that is happening simultaneously, it becomes, in some way I can't quite describe, a sort of comment on life.\"</p>\n","article_links":[{"video_link":"","__total_count__":1,"slideshow_link":"/leisure/photos-from-the-titanic-and-gosford-park"}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite - Article 2.0 (Video Article)","publish_date":"2012-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"22920","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Ostler","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dsela","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_two_video","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6705779","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/julian-fellowes-interview\">Above Deck, Below Deck</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/photos-from-the-titanic-and-gosford-park\">Above Deck, Below Deck</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/arts-and-culture/dan-stevens-interview\">Rare Breed</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/photos-of-downton-abbeys-dan-stevens\">Rare Breed</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/sexiest-men-2013-photos\">T&amp;C's Top 40 Bachelors</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/dining/hotel-dining-reviews-summer-2012\">A Table for Mr. Fox</a><br>\n<a href=\"/leisure/sporting/dr-lewis-h-berman-interview\">Park Avenue's Pet Whisperer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/tradition/estate-management-services\">At Your Service</a><br>\n<a href=\"/society/money-and-power/patricia-kluge-interview\">The Money Pit</a><br>\n<a href=\"/style/fashion-trends/pajama-inspired-clothing\">Bedroom Stories</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1295","last_updated_date":"2013-02-01T16:11:25.000Z","author_id":"103794","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"townandcountry","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Town & Country","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/julian-fellowes-interview","issue_date":"April 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Everyone knows that Costco is the best-kept secret of the thrifty hostess.

conversation took place while we were driving<strong> </strong>to the mountains for a short ski trip over the kids' February break two years ago. A part of me knew it was coming &#151; knew it, and dreaded it. For the holidays, my husband, Gordon, and I had surprised our 14-year-old with a fancy (read: expensive) mountain bike and our 12-year old with a long-coveted video game system &#151; plus the usual hoodies, books, iTunes gift cards, and stocking stuffers. We were both struggling with our annual post-indulgence hangover, only this time the feeling was more acute. Although Gordon and I, both self-employed, still had work, it was a leaner-than-normal year, and we were living paycheck to irregular paycheck. We had four years to save for college, 20 or so years to add to our meager retirement accounts. So I wasn't surprised when Gordon glanced at me glumly and said, \"We have to stop spending so much money.\"</p>\n<p>Our money conversations usually fall somewhere on the spectrum between awkward and acrimonious, which is why we discuss finances about as often as we hash over his prostate health. But that day I knew Gordon's comment wasn't an accusation; it was an attempt to reach an amicable accord. \"Yeah, you're right; we've been a little out of control lately,\" I agreed.</p>\n<p>Over the previous five years or so, I had racked up a lot of debt&#151;five figures' worth&#151;a somewhat stunning amount that had advanced stealthily, like dry rot, while I was distracted with other things: deadlines, the kids' homework and sports, keeping up with the laundry. I still have no idea where I spent it all. Daily chai lattes at Starbucks? Plane tickets for our annual summer vacation? Clothes? Gifts? Groceries? It's impossible to identify one culprit. I simply <em>frittered it away,</em> as my mom would say. And I suspected Gordon was similarly saddled with debt.</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure, because we'd always kept our money completely separate, on the theory that our erratic incomes and inherent disorganization would doom any attempt at joint banking. Besides, I'd never wanted him scrutinizing my spending habits any more than he wanted me poking around in his. We'd each taken charge of certain bills &#151; he paid the big stuff, like the mortgage and property taxes, while I handled most of the other monthly expenses, including the majority of the groceries &#151; and we bailed each other out if one of us ran short on cash.</p>\n<p>Our arrangement had helped us avoid big money battles, but with no spousal oversight, we'd both been guilty of spending too much and saving too little. \"Maybe we should each make a budget,\" I said tentatively, a part of me secretly hoping he'd say no.</p>\n<p>He looked at me with surprise, like I'd just suggested we pull off to the side of the road for a quickie. \"Really? You'd do that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure; I guess,\" I said.</p>\n<p>He already looked more cheerful. \"Let's do it when we get home.\"</p>\n<p>Even then, our determination might have faded &#151; we'd made big promises before about sitting down and hammering out a budget &#151; had it not been for a curious bit of serendipity. When we got home from our trip, there was a copy of a book in our mailbox, sent by my editor at <em>Good Housekeeping.</em> Called <em><a href=\"http://www.ewealthwatchers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wealth Watchers: A Simple Program to Help You Spend Less and Save More</a>,</em> it applies the principles of Weight Watchers to finances. The premise is simple: Set a daily spending goal, just like you'd set a daily calorie goal, by determining how much cash you actually have available to spend every day; track your daily spending; and watch the debt (like the pounds) melt away and the savings pile up. Alice Wood, the book's author, says she and her husband spent $12,000 less the first year they followed the program than they had the year before. I couldn't imagine cutting even a tenth of that, but I was willing to try.</p>\n<p>Still, we dragged our feet before starting, blaming the usual culprits: work, stress, our over-packed schedules. Finally, at the end of April, we resolved to put ourselves on a financial diet. We broke the news to the boys over dinner one night.</p>\n<p>Will, the older and more emotionally savvy of the two, said it sounded like a good idea, while Griffin moaned, \"Awwwwww, nooooo! Why? We won't ever be able to do anything!\" We assured him that we intended to <em>trim</em> the budget, not machete it &#151; that we just wanted the whole family to become more aware of the difference between wants and needs. Will rolled his eyes, recognizing this new material as part of our ongoing series of Responsible-Behavior Speeches, but Griff brightened. \"OK,\" he said. \"I need to go see <em>Iron Man 2</em> this weekend.\" Clearly, this wasn't going to be easy.</p>\n<p>I called Wood to see what she advised to help us stay the course. She suggested we ask another family to try the program, too &#151; the theory being that behavior change is easier if you have other people offering support and encouragement. There's the Weight Watchers influence again. We enlisted the help of our friends Susan and Charlie, who'd lost their longtime, lucrative jobs &#151; she was in commercial real estate, he was a menswear designer &#151; within two weeks of each other 10 months before and had only piecemeal work since then. Because they didn't have any debt aside from their mortgage and had wisely set aside a solid year's worth of living expenses, they'd been able to stay afloat without making drastic changes like raiding their retirement accounts or selling their home. They'd already cut out most discretionary spending &#151; yard maintenance, expensive haircuts, clothes shopping, gifts. But with no real job prospects on the horizon and two kids around the same ages as ours, we knew they were motivated to pinch pennies &#151; and would be inspiring role models for Gordon and me. Still, I wondered: After 17 years of haphazard spending, could we really trim our budget and get our finances under control?</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"http://goodhousekeeping.com/family/budget/we-saved-10-grand-wealth-watchers-2\">Planning a Budget</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"959630","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/y4/0412-graves-family-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Graves","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6729726","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/budget/common-money-mistakes\">5 Most Common Money Mistakes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-diet\">The Money Diet: How to Achieve Financial Fitness This Year</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/save-more-money\">25 Easy Ways to Save Money this Year</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/survive-recession\">40+ Tips for Saving Money in a Recession</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/125-tips-to-save-money\">125 Ways to Manage Your Money </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/talking-with-your-teen\">Talking with Your Teen About Sex, Drugs, and Money </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/your-money-saving-tips-at-home-1216646745\">Share Your Money -Saving Tips </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/your-money-saving-tips\">Share Your Money -Saving Tips </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/save-money-groceries\">Grocery Money -Saving Secrets</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/money-resolutions\">A Year's Worth of Money Resolutions</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:33:57.000Z","author_id":"8807","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/budget/we-saved-10-grand-wealth-watchers","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Free Union Jack bunting to print out","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"bunting, make bunting, make your own bunting, Union Jack bunting, free bunting, free Union Jack bunting, Jubilee bunting, Olympics bunting, how to sew bunting, sew bunting, sew your own bunting, how to make bunting, make paper bunting, mini  Union Jack bunting, free mini Union Jack bunting, Olympics mini bunting x how to make mini bunting, mini bunting, make your own mini bunting, free mini bunting, Jubilee mini bunting, make paper mini bunting, make mini bunting, triangular bunting, rectangular","rate":"4.75","promo_title":"How to make bunting (plus free Union Jack bunting to print)","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-01-31T17:32:02.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Adrienne","source_id":"641","teaser":"Free Union Jack bunting to print out","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"All you need to sew your own bunting, plus free Union Jack bunting to print out","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"Want to make your own bunting?

For mini bunting, 5cm x 8cm.</p>\n<p>Neaten sides of triangles if you want the bunting to be long-lasting - it's not necessary if the bunting is for one-off short-term use only.</p>\n<p>Press a long length of 2.5cm-wide white cotton tape in half lengthwise.</p>\n<p>Slip tops of triangles inside folded tape and stitch in place with triangles positioned 5cm apart (1.5cm for mini bunting).</p>\n<h3>How to 'fly the flag' with bunting</h3>\n<p>For patriotic bunting, you could buy cheap plastic Union Jacks, cut them into triangles and attach to a tape as described above.</p>\n<p>To echo the colours of the British flag, choose fabrics in reds, whites and blues. These can be plain or printed. Floral fabrics give a contemporary, shabby chic look, and gingham looks neat (and is easy to cut in a straight line). Obviously, if you're supporting another country in the Olympics, you can use the colours of that flag.</p>\n<h3>Print free Union Jack bunting</h3>\n<p><strong></strong>There are two designs to choose from: rectangular and triangular, and two sizes: large - ideal for outdoors; and small - ideal for indoors, over a mirror or a computer, for example.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/make-bunting-Union-Jack-bunting-free-template\" target=\"_self\">Click here for your free rectangular Union Jack bunting&#160;</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/pattern-finder/sewing-projects/sewing-for-the-home/make-bunting-triangular-Union-Jack-bunting-template\" target=\"_self\">Click here for your free triangular Union Jack bunting</a></strong></p>\n<p>Print out on a colour printer, as many copies as the desired length of your bunting, then attach to string or tape with sticky tape or staples.

Get up &#151; right now! Walking away from your chair every half hour while you're at work or at home watching TV or checking out the new espadrilles at <a href=\"http://www.zappos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">zappos.com</a> sounds like the world's easiest prescription. It is &#151; and it just might save your life.</p>\n<p>A recently discovered health threat &#151; uninterrupted butt-in-chair time &#151; boosts your odds of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. In one American Cancer Society study, women who were sedentary for six-plus hours daily &#151; regardless of how active they were at other times &#151; had a 34% higher risk of dying during the 11-year study period than those who stayed seated for less than three hours. There's a weight-loss payoff, too: In one study, Genevieve Healy, Ph.D., a pioneering \"inactivity researcher\" at Australia's University of Queensland, found that people who took more small, low-intensity breaks throughout the day (really tiny, like walking to the printer) were slimmer than long-haul desk jockeys. The breaks don't have to be time-consuming &#151; even one to two minutes is beneficial &#151; but they should be frequent, every half hour or so. And you do need to move your legs: The act of standing and walking contracts the larger muscles of your legs and back, which activates an enzyme that cues muscles to take in fat and sugar from your bloodstream, Healy explains.</p>\n<h3>HOW TO BUILD MINI-BREAKS INTO YOUR DAY...</h3>\n<p>Beyond the usual &#151; popping over to a colleague's office instead of e-mailing her, taking the stairs &#151; try these:</p>\n<p><strong>&#149; STAND UP</strong> to use the phone. Your body works harder &#151; maybe 30% more &#151; when you're on your feet. Pacing is even better.</p>\n<p><strong>&#149; GET RID OF THE WATER BOTTLE</strong> on your desk and walk over to the cooler.</p>\n<p><strong>&#149; GO INTO THE CLOSET</strong> Do some squats while you're retrieving supplies. Need a book from a top shelf? Stretch both arms up, lean left, lean right, and then come back to center to retrieve it.</p>\n<h3>...AND INTO YOUR NIGHT</h3>\n<p><strong>&#149; TURN OFF THE TV</strong> Almost anything you do instead will be healthier than plopping down for more <em>CSI</em> reruns. Bonus &#151; a 2009 study found that overweight people who cut their TV viewing in half burned an extra 120 calories per day. Or:</p>\n<p><strong>&#149; WATCH AND WALK </strong>Think of commercials as workout time, suggests UCLA professor of public health Toni Yancey, M.D. March in place, haul out the resistance bands, or dance.</p>\n<p><strong>&#149; GRAB A BROOM </strong>Use your movement breaks to sweep the floor or dust the windowsills. You &#151; and the house &#151; will be in better shape.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-27T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"959693","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/dx/0412-woman-reaching-toward-shelf-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Harrar","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6729712","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/womens-health/prevent-back-pain\">How to Prevent Back Pain</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/wellness/coping-with-job-loss\">Coping with Job Loss</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/fitness/exercise-tone-body\">8 Exercises to Lose Weight</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/health-news-1007\">Health News -

Thankfully, at the end of all the stressful planning there&#146;s a holiday to enjoy &#150; and by the time it comes around you&#146;ll need a relaxing break even more than you did to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>If your holiday party is plus one this year, however, the stress can sometimes follow you onto your travels. Holidays with children can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience, the trick to avoid extra stress lies within the pre-holiday preparation.</p> \n\n<p>After a new addition to the family, the <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/finance/savings-investments\"target=\"_blank\">savings account</a> can often suffer. A holiday, therefore, needs to be low-cost as well as child-friendly. The sort of holiday that appeals to young and carefree adults isn&#146;t necessarily the best place to holiday with a child. The requirements, needs and expectations of a holiday change &#150; you no longer want to sunbathe and survive on cocktails, but a family experience packed full of adventure and memories to forever treasure.</p> \n\n<p>You will need to spend more time than before thinking carefully about accommodation &#150; the hostels, tents and hotels of the past may need to upgrade to a more family-friendly cottage, apartment or villa in order to meet your new parenting needs.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever you decide to go, you need to ensure that it is suitable to your child&#146;s needs and that there is plenty to do. For a lot of holidays, the premise of the holiday&#146;s activities will be what you would do at home, only bigger, better and more enjoyable. If your child likes animals, going somewhere near to a zoo or animal centre will offer a twist of normality with a guaranteed happy face.</p> \n\n<p>A holiday abroad comes with more preparation and possible stress than a break nearer to home, you need to consider <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/travel/travel-insurance\"target=\"_blank\">travel insurance</a> and <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/travel/travel-money/foreign-currency\"target=\"_blank\">foreign currency</a> as well as all the usual parenting tools required to get you through the day tantrum-free. The extra stress will be worth it, however, as soon as you step off the plane. Ensure that you choose the option that will allow for the fastest travel &#150; a short flight as opposed to three trains and the Eurostar. Holidays abroad, however are often suited to children that are slightly older, as they will get more out of the holiday.</p> \n\n<p>For a holiday closer to home, there&#146;s a wealth of child-friendly activities dotted around the UK, including over 50 zoos and wildlife parks. There are also many play centres dotted around the UK &#150; with small children you have the luxury of keeping it simple.</p>\n<p>If you&#146;re stuck for ideas, your nearest Centre Parc could be an option &#150; as they are child friendly and very flexible. Similarly, a beach is an ideal location for a low-key holiday that will keep any child amused. </p>\n\n<p>Even if the holiday incurs more stress than you first realised, you&#146;ll have brilliant memories and photos of your first family holiday to look back on. </p>\n \n \n \n","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-03-20T08:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"12575","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Alexander","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-aalexande","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6961940","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641978\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641977\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641976\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641975\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641973\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641972\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641971\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641969\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641968\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/community/forums/thread/1641967\">Babyexpert is changing today - please read!</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-04-20T10:09:48.000Z","author_id":"10994","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"primababyuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-28T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Prima Baby","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.babyexpert.com/new-family/trips/choosing-first-family-holiday-post-office","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Make spring entertaining easy with a midday buffet filled with do-ahead dishes","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"recipes, lunch, holiday, buffet, easter, brunch, menu, midday meal","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Make-Ahead Easter Menu","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-10T14:49:13.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/holidays/easy-easter-buffet","link_text":"An Effortless &amp;

Because of the sugar in it, she's dancing around the bedroom instead of winding down at night.</p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>Three words that describe you as a mom?</b></p>\n<p>\"Loving,\" \"fun,\" and \"respectful.\" I hope those also describe me as a wife.</p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>Is there one beauty product you can't live without?</b></p>\n<p>Aloe lotion. It seems to be good for everything.</p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>What are you reading right now?</b></p>\n<p>The new Ellen DeGeneres book. She's so funny; it's a book I can actually read without falling asleep. </p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>What's on your nightstand?</b></p>\n<p>Tissues, because there's always a runny nose in the house; an alarm clock that needs batteries; a book called <i>Coping With Preschool Panic</i>; and a crafting-with-kids book. </p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>What's a date night for you and Alexis?</b></p>\n<p>It's usually a nice restaurant and maybe some ice cream. Occasionally, it's Target. It's like, \"Hey, let's go to the store without Satyana and actually shop.\"</p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>Who does the cooking in your house?</b></p>\n<p>My husband is a fantastic cook. He's like MacGyver in the kitchen. I'll be like, \"We have nothing,\" and he'll come up with a gourmet meal. </p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>Do you have a favorite family ritual?</b></p>\n<p>Satyana and I bake muffins together, and Daddy takes pictures.</p>\n<br /> \n<p><b>How do you stay connected with girlfriends? </b></p>\n<p>They all come over and craft. I make cards and do knitting and felting.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"961333","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/RF/ghk-alyson-hannigan-child-motherhood-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Pellettieri","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6729702","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/alyson-hannigan-interview\">This Mom's Life: Alyson Hannigan </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/dog-behavior\">Decoding Your Dog's Behavior</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/parenting-tips/mothers-in-prison\">A Mother's Day Gift</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/are-you-good-mother\">Are You a Good Mother ?

you are, trucking along in your life, your marriage. Maybe you're six months out from the altar, or two years, or 12, or 20. Your husband is unaccountably late coming home from work again. Or he's distant or cranky again. Or, as in my case, he leaves his rancid gym clothes on the clean bedspread again. Or he butchers an entire pig in your kitchen again (yes! He's taken the whole know-where-your-meat-comes-from thing to the extreme). And you think, no matter how happy or in love you felt just yesterday, <em>Good grief, wouldn't all this be easier without YOU?</em> Marriage is long and hard. It's no picnic, yet at times it feels like a joke: Millions of us are trying to move &#151; and grow, and breathe &#151; while shackled to another person, as if in a three-legged race. Wouldn't it be easier to div &#151; ?</p>\n<p>And yet, the D-word. It's so dire. No person stays committed forever without at least contemplating life solo, but do you really want to amputate your sometimes better half? Here, a panel of wise authors, therapists, artists, lawyers, and scientists makes the case for sticking it out. Even if your union is rosy right now, consider this required reading. Use it to appreciate, nurture, and take a mental snapshot of what you have. Some day you may find yourself (or a dear friend) on the brink, and you'll want the best tools possible to help you remember what's at stake and salvage what you've got. With that in mind, try these tips to save your marriage before you sign the divorce papers.</p>","slide_title":"Whatever it takes","custom_slide_links":[{"slide_links":[{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/things-men-love#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/redbook/images/ul/rbk-couple-in-bathroom-smn.jpg","link_title":"Things Men Hope You Love About Them","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/new-sex-positions#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/redbook/images/mo/chess-pawn-sm.jpg","link_title":"10 New Sex Positions to Try","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/marriage-tips#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/redbook/images/A0/rbk-stupid-joke-2-0610-smn.jpg","link_title":"Good (and Bad) Old Marriage Advice","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/tips-for_fun-date-nights#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/redbook/images/Bs/woman-in-tub-sm.jpg","link_title":"20 Ways to Spice Up Date Night","link_text":""}],"__total_count__":1,"link_heading":"More Love and Sex:"}],"slide_credit":"Nick Dolding","slide_links_type":"Custom","sponsorship":"Nothing","slide_type":"Image"}],"article_type_name":"Flip Book 3","publish_date":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"961020","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20969","promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/Ah/rbk-divorce-0412-7-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Weil","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"flipbook3","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6680877","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/love-sex/celebrity-divorces\">What We Can Learn from Celebrity Divorces</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/friends-divorce\">What a Friend's Divorce Means for Your Marriage </a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/healthy-relationships/how-to-save-a-marriage\">Don't Even Think About Divorcing Until...</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/love-lessons-ll\">Love Lessons Ripped from the Headlines!</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/advice-for-marriage\">Beat Divorce : How to Keep a Lasting Love</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage-makeovers/save-your-marriage\">5 Couples Reveal: \"The Extreme Ways We Saved Our Marriages\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/marriage-weight\">4 Ways Marriage Makes You Fat (and How to Stop It)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/living-with-an-ex-after-divorce\">\"Apartners:\" The New Happy Divorce </a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/divorce-proof-marriage\">7 Strategies to Divorce -Proof Your Marriage </a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/couples-confess-happy-marriage\">2,100 Couples Confess: What You Really Need for a Happy Marriage </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"headline_image_id":"961019","print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1365","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:16:35.000Z","author_id":"37913","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/how-to-save-a-marriage","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"We remixed your basics with 8 new &#151;

What drew you to the part?</strong></p>\n<p>Martin has a special-needs child, and he's desperate to be a good dad. I was moved by his journey.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>You have a daughter, Sarah, who's 24. Can you relate to Martin as a parent?</strong></p>\n<p>I was 20 when my daughter was born, and making all these plans during my wife's pregnancy. I was going to be the perfect father. Once she was born, it was suddenly, \"Oh, my God! I'm a parent!\" Martin is dealing with that on a more extreme level. But everyone feels inadequate as parents.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about your relationship with Sarah.</strong></p>\n<p>We've always been really good at communicating. Probably because I was so young when I had her, I didn't talk down to her as a child. So we've had a very even relationship.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>She teases you for not being tech-savvy...</strong></p>\n<p>She'll go, \"Dad, can you help me with this computer?\" then wait a beat and say, \"Oh, that's right. <em>You can't</em>.\" I'm not a computer person. On <em>24</em>, when I had to have the requisite skills, there were people who helped me fake it really well.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>You've also been married twice--almost three times. What have you learned about women?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the most difficult thing is to have an intimate relationship. I was married to my first wife for 10 years, and we're still great friends. She already had a child, and then we had Sarah, and we raised two daughters together. My second wife had two beautiful sons before I met her, but I was going farther and farther away for work. It was painful, and it didn't work out. Distance can be incredibly frustrating.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>What qualities in women most attract you?</strong></p>\n<p>I'd say confidence, and I seem to be attracted to people who are into painting and music, or at least an appreciation of those things. And strength is also something I'm drawn to.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>You still make the papers after a wild night out. Are you partying, or just misunderstood?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm not walking around feeling misunderstood. Some days I'm in better control and can navigate my way through stuff, and other days, not so much.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Last year you starred on Broadway with Jason Patric in <em>That Championship Season</em>. He famously ran off with Julia Roberts on the day you were supposed to marry her. Does that mean all is forgiven?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Jason and I are great friends. It was an absolute joy to be in this play with him, that his father wrote and won a Pulitzer Prize for.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>And soon you start production on the <em>24</em> movie. How will it feel to be Jack Bauer again?</strong></p>\n<p>Like going home to a long-lost friend. --MARISA FOX</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>KIEFER AT A GLANCE...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>His idol:</strong>&#160;His dad, Donald.&#160;\"I didn't know what a prolific actor he was until I was 18.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly exercise:</strong> Hockey.&#160;\"I'm a Canadian to the marrow.

As seasoned scenesters party at a swank soiree on the top floor, a few floors below, the coolest cast in town has assembled to film the opening scene in the exceptionally funny new rom-com <em>Friends With Kids</em>. Celebrity chaos reigns: Waiting off-camera for their cues, Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm dance exaggeratedly together (pantomiming the pull of an invisible rope) while Maya Rudolph belts out \"Weird Science,\" until finally <em>Parks and Recreation</em>'s It guy Adam Scott, together with the woman of the hour &#151; a superbly coiffed Jennifer Westfeldt wrapped in a navy dress &#151; rush in to kick off the pivotal scene. Just another day on set with a comedic dream team.</p>\n<p>You already know Westfeldt &#151; she's the willowy blonde nestled next to Jon Hamm (her boyfriend of 15 years) at every awards show. Just don't confuse her for one of Tinseltown's wannabe-actress girlfriends: Westfeldt, 42, has an impressive r&#233;sum&#233; of her own, having written and starred in the breakout indies <em>Kissing Jessica Stein</em> and <em>Ira & Abby</em>. For the past five years, though, she's taken on small roles in big shows (<em>Grey's Anatomy</em>, <em>24</em>) while her boyfriend's career has exploded. Now, with <em>Friends With Kids</em> set to open, Westfeldt &#151; who wrote, directed, and stars in the film &#151; continues her steady climb up.</p>\n<p>The movie spotlights platonic besties Jason (Scott) and Julie (Westfeldt), who've watched their friends' marriages crumble after having kids. The pair hatch a plan to avoid the same grim fate by having a baby together but vowing to continue their search for romantic soul mates. The scheme screams disaster, but don't expect spit-up clich&#233;s here: Witty, poignant, and raunchy (see: vagina-stretching jokes), <em>Friends With Kids</em> offers a textured, modern look at love, adult friendships, and the new permutations on the traditional family. \"Four years ago, Jon's and my friends started having babies, and everything became so kid-centric,\" chirps Westfeldt in her girlish trill, at a bistro on the Upper West Side. \"You miss one-on-one time with your friends. When you're childless and close friends become new parents, you suddenly feel left out, and that's where the kernel of this idea came from.\"</p>\n<p>Despite its spectacular cast (Ed Burns and Megan Fox costar), her directorial debut was rife with, well, drama. \"I juggled winter, children, and animals,\" laughs Westfeldt of the Manhattan shoot that faced a freak 36-inch snowfall last winter. The fussy-kid fix was easy &#151; \"Give them an iPhone!\" swears Westfeldt &#151; but battling Mother Nature proved more complicated. \"We had snow-removal teams, shovels, actors chewing on ice chips so you couldn't see their breath on camera,\" says Westfeldt. \"One day our lenses froze, and we defrosted them with blowdryers.\"</p>\n<p>The film was developed by Points West, Westfeldt and Hamm's new production company, and while working closely with a romantic partner might prove ruinous for some couples, Westfeldt says she and Hamm relished the opportunity. \"We've had so much chaos with <em>Mad Men</em>, Jon's incredible fame, and flying back and forth just to spend 36 hours together, that this was the most day-in, day-out interaction we've had in a while. It was great,\" she says. \"But because I'm always pushing to live in Manhattan, with 10-degree weather, I was like, 'Come on, city, make my man excited about moving here, please!'\"</p>\n<p>Today, Westfeldt is busy developing three other projects. \"It's exciting to take control of your future instead of waiting for the phone to ring,\" she admits. \"It's the smart thing to do.\" And who knows &#151; with <em>Friends With Kids</em> a runaway hit at the Toronto Film Festival, it may soon be Hamm who's relegated to arm candy.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-09T15:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Henderson","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"avingan","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6949830","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/jennifer-westfeldt-interview\">Jennifer Westfeldt : Calling the Shots</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/jennifer-garner-jessica-biel-interview\">Girl Crush: Jennifer and Jessica</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/jennifer-connelly-slide\">Jennifer Connelly: All Dressed Up</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/jennifer-love-hewitt-quotes\">Jennifer Love Hewitt Dishes on Dating</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/Jennifer_Connelly\">The Actor's Actor: Jennifer Connelly</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/just-not-that-into-you-interview\">Gossip Girls</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fashion/trends/designer-dossier-valentino\">Designer Dossier: Valentino</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/behind-Jennifer-Garner\">Behind the Scenes with Jennifer Garner</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/how-to/jennifer-connelly-beauty-tips\">Jennifer Connelly: Lady in Red</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/marie-claire-jennifer-connelly-cover-shoot-video-900316471001\">Marie Claire: Jennifer Connelly Cover Shoot Video</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T17:27:34.000Z","author_id":"5232","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"marieclaire","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Marie Claire","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/jennifer-westfeldt-interview","issue_date":"03/01/2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"579","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.company.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Feel you can wear your top twice!","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-03-09T12:32:08.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Theresa","source_id":"641","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"579","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"cleansensation","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-02-14T15:02:22.000Z","title":"Feel you can wear your top twice!","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Feel you can wear your top twice!","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"505","active":"Y","site_id":"579","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-jwood","last_name":"Caney","email":"Theresa.Caney@natmags.co.uk","creation_date":"2010-12-16T15:10:51.000Z","id":"11081","last_updated_date":"2010-12-16T15:10:51.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Theresa"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/company/Garnier/garnierclean.gif\" alt=\"some text\" width=\"300\" height=\"329\" style=\"float: right;\" />Want to know the key to getting more than one wear from that top?

As for flossing, who has time in the mornings between making the kids&#146; packed lunches and urgent work calls!<br />\n  <br />\n  Well, thanks to Philips&#146; latest innovations &#150; the brilliant new <strong>Sonicare <a href=\"http://www.sonicare.com/dp/ca_en/OurProducts/DiamondClean.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">DiamondClean</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.sonicare.com/dp/ca_en/OurProducts/AirFloss.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">AirFloss</a></strong> &#150; you can now recreate that dentist-clean feeling at home. They deliver whiter teeth in just one week, and healthier gums in two weeks. What&#146;s more, they are super easy to use and even quite fun (seriously, just try the AirFloss&#151;and check out the drinking glass charger! But more of that later), which means looking after your teeth has just got a whole lot easier.<br /> \n  <br />\n  The DiamondClean toothbrush has bristles that gently clean (rather than scratch) your gums, and a small head to get to those tricky areas. Just like a professional clean will lift away any persistent plaque, the Sonicare DiamondClean is clinically proven to remove up to 100% more plaque from hard-to-reach areas than a manual toothbrush, leaving your teeth looking whiter and your gums healthier.<br />\n  <br />\n  It has a selection of brushing modes; &#145;Gum Care&#146; will softly massage your gums as you brush, and &#145;Sensitive&#146; mode brushes extra gently for sensitive teeth. It also offers a more efficient brushing experience; brush heads that are diamond shaped allow 44% more bristles to be squeezed in than Philips standard sized ProResults heads. The result? Better plaque removal and a brilliant clean in half the time. <br />\n  <br />\n  As an added extra it even looks great in your bathroom. The ceramic and chrome finish is super stylish and it comes with a world-first drinking glass charger (which you can actually drink from!).<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Fuss-free flossing</strong><br />\n  <br />\n  What can be fuss-free about flossing, you might be thinking? Indeed, in a recent survey by Philips, 82% of people said that they didn&#146;t bother flossing because it was &#147;too difficult&#148;. Well, listen to this: the new Sonicare AirFloss works with just air and water &#150; no awkward ribbons at all! <br />\n  <br />\nThe revolutionary microburst technology uses rapid bursts of air and water droplets&#151;which travel at up to 45mph&#151;to force plaque and bacteria out from between your teeth. It sounds tough, but is actually very gentle on the gums and can take only 60 seconds to clean your entire mouth. Pretty handy on mornings when you are juggling kids&#146; breakfasts, work and the school run. You&#146;ll be amazed at how simple it is to use, and once you notice how brilliantly clean your teeth are you&#146;ll wonder how you did without it all these years.</p>\n<p><strong>5 tips for a healthy smile</strong><br />\n  <br />\n  A great toothbrush is only good if you use it properly; follow these tips for top teeth! <br />\n  <br />\n1.<strong>Brush before breakfast</strong> &#150; acidic foods like orange juice can soften the enamel of your teeth, so brush before you eat or you could be removing your teeth&#146;s protection. </p>\n<p>2.<strong>Get your timing right</strong> &#150; we should be brushing for a full 2 minutes morning and night (the average we usually manage is 68 seconds). Use a time to check you are brushing enough, or not too much. Over brushing can be damaging too. </p>\n<p>3.<strong>Go electric</strong> &#150; using an electric toothbrush really does reap rewards. Philips Sonicare DiamondClean removes 100% more plaque in hard to reach areas than a manual toothbrush. Just remember to change your brush heads regularly.</p>\n<p>4.<strong>Don&#146;t forget flossing</strong> &#150; it is an important preventative measure against tooth decay and gum disease. Floss once a day, before you brush, without it you&#146;re only cleaning the surfaces of your teeth. AirFloss will remove 99% more floss than manual brushing alone can do. </p>\n<p>5.<strong>Up your water intake</strong> &#150; drinking water does wonders for your mouth, neutralising bacteria in your saliva and keeping your moth fresh and feeling clean. </p>\n\n<br>\n\n<strong> <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/competitions/22455\" target=\"_blank\">For your chance to WIN a Sonicare Airfloss, click here. </a>\n\n</br>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-03-08T11:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"959885","votes":"12","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":"/cm/allaboutyou/images/1W/promoImage.gif","total_rate":"53.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Bonney","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-dbasye","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6655746","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T22:40:51.000Z","author_id":"37834","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-02-15T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/Two-new-reasons-to-smile","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"watch: Marni for H&M campaign video","site_id":"603","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"video, Marni, H&M, fashion, sofia coppola, imogen poots, ss12","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Woo -

days of quaint savings passbooks (remember those?) and a free toaster for opening a new checking account are gone. Now you're more likely to manage your savings online and get billed when you open a checking account. With all the new fees, regulations, and teeny interest rates on savings, banking has become confusing and costly. Let me shed some light on a few of your most common banking questions &#151; and help you keep more of your hard-earned cash.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm relieved that my bank isn't charging for my debit card usage, but I'm still seeing all kinds of fees on my monthly statements. What gives? </strong></p>\n<p>Would you believe that numerous banks have as many as 49 possible fees for checking accounts? And many have raised monthly fees to an average that's creeping close to $15 &#151; ouch! So review your monthly bank statements now and see what you're being charged for. It's becoming increasingly common to pay fees for such transactions as making a transfer or payment over the phone. And some banks charge $3 for using an out-of-network ATM; plus, that ATM may well debit you <em>another</em> $3 for the privilege of accessing the cash.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are no-fee banking options out there &#151; and tools to help you shop for them. For example, Ally Bank offers a free online checking account that requires no minimum balance and allows you to deposit checks online (you scan the check and send it electronically) for no additional charge. There are no ATM fees, either. And ING Direct USA has free checking accounts that even earn interest (every little bit counts). Scour bank reviews (ratings on customer service, fees, etc.) at <a href=\"http://www.mybanktracker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mybanktracker.com</a> &#151; and don't rule out credit unions, which have some of the lowest checking fees around <em>and</em> are more likely to offer lower-interest loans and credit cards. You can look for credit unions at the National Credit Union Administration website, <a href=\"http://www.ncua.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">ncua.gov</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>I've saved some cash for an emergency fund, but it earns hardly any interest in my savings account. Could it do better elsewhere?</strong></p>\n<p>Remember the days of earning 4.5% on our savings accounts? Well, don't hold your breath for that to happen again soon. The Federal Reserve, which determines many interest rates, has said it'll hold the line at or close to 0% at least through 2013. Banks will keep interest rates just as low &#151; great for loans and credit cards, but bad for savings. Still, you might as well try to offset the cost of inflation and earn just a tad on your moola. Shop around for savings accounts with <em>some</em> yield &#151; online banks and credit unions offer 1% or thereabouts &#151; at sites like <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bankrate.com</a>. And keep in mind that if your checking and savings accounts are with the same bank, you may be able to link them for a larger, combined balance, thereby avoiding low-balance fees on your checking account. You could wind up a couple of hundred dollars richer in a year thanks to that one simple move.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"/family/budget/lowering-interest-rates\">The benefits of

of my Secrets of Adulthood is \"What I do <em>every day</em> matters more than what I do <em>once in a while.</em>\" But it's easy to kid myself about what I do every day, as part of my usual routine, and what I do once in a while.</p>\n<p>If I'm not careful, I can convince myself of statements like \"Most days, I go to the gym,\" \"I eat lots of fruits and vegetables every day,\" \"I rarely show my exasperation in front of my daughters,\" and \"Each day, I write for at least three hours.\"</p>\n<p>To combat this tendency, I keep a daily Resolution Chart, where I score myself on whether I've kept my resolutions (or not). This record helps keep me honest about what my daily routine <em>actually</em> looks like &#151; not what I <em>think</em> it looks like or what I <em>wish</em> it looked like. When I see on my chart that I haven't really been getting much exercise, I'm more likely to head to the gym.</p>\n<p>In thinking about happiness, it's easy to focus on exceptional events &#151; the significant good or bad things that happen to me. However, I've realized that my ordinary, run-of-the-mill routine also has a huge influence on my happiness. I'm a big fan of architect Christopher Alexander's strange, brilliant writing (his book <em>A Pattern Language </em>utterly changed the way I view my home), and I was struck by a passage from one of his books on architecture, <em>The Timeless Way of Building:</em> \"Being in bed, having a shower, having breakfast in the kitchen, sitting in my study writing, walking in the garden, cooking and eating our common lunch at my office with my friends, going to the movies, taking my family to eat at a restaurant...going to bed again. There are a few more,\" he writes of his routines.</p>\n<p>\"There are surprisingly few [routines] in any one person's way of life, perhaps no more than a dozen. Look at your own life and you will find the same. It is shocking at first, to see that there are so few patterns of events open to me.</p>\n<p>\"Not that I want more of them. But when I see how very few of them there are, I begin to understand what huge effect these few patterns have.... If [they] are good for me, I can live well. If they are bad for me, I can't.\"</p>\n<p>For instance, a good friend inspired me to improve our busy school-day-morning routine. \"I work, so the morning is one of the main times I see my kids,\" she told me, \"but for a long time, it wasn't enjoyable for any of us. Too much nagging, yelling, and whining. I realized that I'd better do something about it, because we didn't have that much time together. The morning was just too important to our family to waste it on bickering.\"</p>\n<p>After I heard that, I adopted several resolutions aimed at making my family's school-day mornings more calm and cheery. Each night, I spent 10 minutes tidying up so I wouldn't emerge into a supermessy apartment in the morning. I started going to bed earlier, to be better rested &#151; and I started waking up earlier so I could organize myself before my family woke up. I started singing in the morning to put myself in a lighthearted mood.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong> Next: <a href=\"/health/wellness/happiness-project-daily-routine-problems-2\"> Feel happier with slight daily routine changes</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-08T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"960068","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/sg/gretchen-rubin-0311-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Rubin","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-gretchen-rubin","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6729697","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/happiness-project-daily-routine-problems\">Scheduling Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/keep-new-years-resolution\">How to Keep Your New Year&rsquo;s Resolution </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/find-your-happy-place\">Find Your Happy Place</a><br>\n<a href=\"/author-bio/about-gretchen-rubin\">About Gretchen Rubin </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/happiness-project-proofs-of-love\">How Giving Love Makes You Feel Loved</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/wellness/tracking-goals\">The Happiness Project: Counting What Counts</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/how-to-be-happier\">7 Surprising Ways to Be Happier at Home</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/serve-others\">The Happiness Boomerang</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/find-happiness-holiday-season\">Unwrapping Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/get-your-life-back\">How to Get Your Life Back After the Holidays</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:33:48.000Z","author_id":"11109","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/happiness-project-daily-routine-problems","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"The irreverent new movie <em>Friends With Kids</em> explores whether there's life &#151; and love, and hotness &#151; after children.

I had terrible memories of driving from New York to Ohio from my own childhood. Fortunately, we've never done that. We did have one trip to Lake Tahoe and sat in traffic for four hours....</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Westfeldt (who also wrote and directed the film):</strong> Isn't it more of an effort to take your family on a plane, with security being such a big hassle, and you're dealing with a baby, a stroller, and diaper bags? I thought driving would at least be calmer.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Ed: </strong>Not long-distance. The other thing we said is that we'd take the dogs with us on every trip. But the minute you have your first child, your dog is just a dog again.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Scott: </strong>I broke every single one of those rules &#151; not taking my kids to restaurants, not taking them on airplanes &#151; and I'm self-righteous about it. I shoot dirty looks right back and am ready to throw down with anyone. When you're holding a screaming kid, the last thing you need is some stranger judging you.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: So you're okay when someone boards a plane with a screaming child?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adam: </strong>I definitely have a newfound sympathy for them, but I still don't want them sitting next to me!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Maya Rudolph: </strong>In the old days, I would have been super-bummed to sit near that lady. Now I'm that lady! I try to at least make sure my kid isn't the one kicking the back of your seat. What I don't like is neglectful parenting. I mean, come on! Rein your kids in.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Hamm (Westfeldt's real-life boyfriend):</strong> And I'm the one who's like, \"Give him to me.\" Honestly, I used to be a day-care teacher, and I took care of my sisters' kids. I get that it's a drag, not only for the people on the plane but mostly for the parents who are desperate to make it better. That said, there is nothing more annoying than an oblivious mom, chatting on her cell, banging into everything she walks by. That's when I want to say, \"Get your face out of your phone and pay attention to your kid!\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: First off, where were you, Jon, when I was on a plane with my screaming son? Second, I want to hear more about what drives you nuts about your friends with kids. </strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jon: </strong>Well, it's a reality check for your friendship, because there's not a lot of time in a new parent's life to do anything but take care of that baby. It's harder for women, because girlfriend relationships are so much about communication. Guys can check in every few months and it's cool.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> That's true. The hardest thing is when I'm trying to have a conversation and my friend is obviously distracted, because her primary focus is on her child. As it should be! But it's still frustrating.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What about you, parents? What bugs you about your friends who <em>don't</em> have kids? </strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ed: </strong>When they call at bath- and bedtime. You think they're checking the clock, thinking about your life. Clearly, they are not.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Maya:</strong> I'm envious that they can go to a bar and hang out, or just go shopping and be out all day and not feel guilty...</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam: </strong>...and that they get to sleep in and just pick up and travel whenever they feel like it.

I hope this message find you in a good health and have a wonderful day.\n <br /><br />\nMy name is Marco who is 37yo, single, never married, no kids. It sounds funny when I say it out loud.  I am an honest guy who treats lady right, but I have been missing my chance to find someone who I can share life with.  Why?  This is a wonderful question; I have been work very hard through years and it is also difficult to find someone through working environment.  I don't like the bar scene.  So here I am, online dating. \n<br /><br />\nI believe good relationship starts being friends.  If we can write each other first or go out to have a cup of coffee/ tea, so we have a chance to know each other better.  How do you think?\n<br /><br />\nThank you for your time to read all of this and look forward to hearing from you soon\n Marco</i>\n<br /><br />\nYES, seriously, this little gem landed in my Match.com inbox <i>on the first day I joined</i>. My ego has taken a serious hit in light of the fact that until him, the only other guy my photo has attracted is without a doubt a serial killer who wants to skin me and wear me when it rains. \n<br /><br />\nBut as Celine says, the heart will go on. And I will be here, documenting every twist and turn my newly single life takes along the way. The next time you hear from me, hopefully I will have some positive news to share about this blind date I&#146;m going on with my co-worker&#146;s boyfriend&#146;s friend (say it three times fast). The guy already sounds like a major upgrade from my Match.com suitor as I&#146;ve confirmed via Facebook that he&#146;s cute, and via my co-worker that he&#146;s nice and not addicted to online porn. Check back in with me in a few days to find out how everything went and whether or not he&#146;s good in bed. (Kidding.) Also, if you love a good, juicy break-up story, then have I got a doozy for you. \n<br /><br />\n"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-03-07T23:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Knoll","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"dadeeyo","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6814212","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/cosmo-for-guys/how-to-look-sexier-online\">The Secret to Looking Sexier Online </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/dating-advice/worst-online-dating-stories-ever-told\">Online Dating Horror Stories</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/technology-and-dating\">6 Ways Technology Has Changed Dating </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cosmo-for-guys/ask-her-anything-cfg-blog-110111\">Ask Her Anything</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cosmo-for-guys/women-relationship-obsessed-cfg-blog\">We're Not All Relationship Obsessed</a><br>\n<a href=\"/quizzes-games/dating-quizzes\">Dating Quizzes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/dating-advice/dating-too-much\">The New Dating Mistake You May Be Making</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/dating-advice/how-to-write-an-online-dating-profile\">The 5 Secrets of an Alluring Dating Profile</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/relationship-advice/turn-offs-for-guys\">8 Online Habits That Are Total Turn Offs for Guys</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity/exclusive/dating-a-coworker-tips-012412\">Read This Before You Start Dating a Coworker</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2008-12-01T17:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"296","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T07:24:36.000Z","author_id":"6485","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"cosmopolitan","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Cosmopolitan","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/bedroom-blog/j-bedroom-blog-good-match-my-ass","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Greetings everyone.

Eating all my favorite foods is how I gained weight in the first place.</em> But this time, it's for real. This plan features famous favorites, as well as swaps in case you prefer other indulgences.</p>\n<p>There's a scientific reason for following a weight-loss program that doesn't involve wholesale deprivation. Dieters who restrict themselves too much&#151;give up all or most of an entire food category, like fat or carbs &#151; for even just three days get an irresistible yearning for the food they're not allowed to have. That's what prominent obesity researcher Janet Polivy, Ph.D., and her colleagues at the University of Toronto have found. Even anticipated deprivation &#151; you know you're about to start a diet &#151; can trigger the mother of all eating binges in the days beforehand. This phenomenon is so common, researchers have coined a name for it: the \"Last Supper effect.\"</p>\n<p>It's all about survival. \"You can't stop eating. It's like holding your breath indefinitely underwater,\" says Mehmet Oz, M.D., host of <em>The Dr. Oz Show</em> and a cardiac surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia in New York City. \"So your body has a very concrete set of systems that reinforce the need for you to eat.\"</p>\n<p>The problem with deprivation, even of calories, \"is that you violate the biology of blubber,\" says Dr. Oz. What happens is this: When you're trying to lose weight, your body is rarely up for it. It doesn't interpret \"diet\" the way you do, as a way to get healthy and fit into your bathing suit this summer. Lose just a few pounds, and your body thinks, <em>She's starving! </em>and swings into action. \"Low-calorie diets send a panic message to the brain to relay a starvation signal to the rest of the body,\" says Dr. Oz. \"Instead of losing the weight you wanted to, your body stores fat as a natural protective mechanism.\"</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, a new study from the University of Melbourne in Australia found that when you've lost some weight, levels of your appetite-regulating hormone, leptin, drop, increasing your desire to eat everything in sight. Who hasn't been there? Apparently, very few of us. UCLA researchers found that some two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost within four to five years. No wonder one of the biggest risk factors for weight gain is being on a weight-loss diet.</p>\n<p>If that's happened to you, chances are you've been trying to squeeze into a diet that doesn't fit you any better than a size 0 bikini. What you should be doing is tailoring your diet to your life and tastes, because \"if a diet doesn't fit, you'll quit,\" says Dr. Oz.</p>\n<p>The \"Eat What You Love\" plan works because it's not a diet. A diet is something you go \"on\" and \"off.\" While you're on it, your fantasies revolve around the feasts you'll have when you go off it. But you won't be tempted to go off this plan, because you won't be giving up your favorite foods &#151; you'll just be wiser about the choices you make. You won't get hungry, because you'll be consuming enough calories (1,450 a day) to override your body's starvation meter, and you'll be eating foods that contain enough fat, protein, and fiber to make you feel full longer. You'll also be satisfying your \"hedonic hunger\" &#151; the need for food that gives you pleasure. That way, you won't have to \"eat around\" your craving, noshing on everything to avoid eating what you really want. And sometimes you should just go for that favorite food, says Dr. Oz: \"You don't have to have a lot of it. A small chocolate chip cookie won't kill you. But be aware of the food &#151; how it tastes and the comfort it brings. Otherwise, you might eat two or three or the whole bag.\"</p>\n<p>Best of all, on this plan you won't have to turn into a short-order cook at home. Your spouse and kids can eat what they love, too. You can even take a break from cooking (check out choices from favorite eateries at left).</p>\n<p>And because we've provided easy food swaps (see <a href=\"http://goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-plans/dr-oz-eat-what-you-love-diet-plan\">Smart Substitutions</a>), you can continue the diet &#151; and watch the pounds drop off &#151; until you lose the weight you want to, keeping it interesting by varying the recipes and menus. Once you reach your goal, use the plan as your guide and try upping portion size slightly or adding in an extra snack or side with a meal. But keep your eye on the scale; if you gain three pounds, that's the signal to cut back.</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"http://goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-plans/dr-oz-eat-what-you-love-diet-plan\">The Fast Weight-Off Plan</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-03-07T13:45:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"959022","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/QO/0412-dr-oz-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Foley","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6729720","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/dr-oz-eat-what-you-love-diet\">Dr .

51&#8260;2 miles<br />Start: Limekiln car park, next to the River Otter in Budleigh Salterton.<br />&#8226; Take the path at the far corner of the car park leading alongside the River Otter. The path you are walking on is the old sea wall built during the Napoleonic wars to protect the low-lying land from flooding. The cricket ground to your left is unique: it&#8217;s below sea level. The Otter Estuary to the right is a wetlands nature reserve with waders, ducks and sea birds. &#160;<br />&#8226; Cross the Otter at White Bridge, the first bridge on the river. Look out for shoals of grey mullet gliding through the shallow tidal waters.<br />&#8226; You have a choice of routes to Otterton. To the left, the old road is now closed to vehicles and reverting to a green lane. The longer route turns right to follow the signed South West Coast Path. Climb the path along the cliffs &#8211; the ruin of a wartime observation post marks the highest point of the walk. To the east, view the red cliffs of Ladram Bay, Sidmouth and the white cliffs of Beer Head. <br />&#8226; As the path drops down, turn left along a signed permissive path towards Otterton. A crossroads of lanes offers a choice of ways to Otterton &#8211;&#160; take your pick. Reward yourself with cream tea beside the river at Otterton Mill: those who took the short cut will be there already.<br />&#8226; Cross the bridge by the mill and turn left along the riverside path towards Budleigh Salterton. At White Bridge (once again) turn right along the lane that crosses the water-meadows and twists up to join a main road. Across the road is an old railway bridge. Climb the path at its right-hand side to get on to the old railway line path into Budleigh Salterton. Leave the path through the gate beside a metal footbridge, cross the road and walk up Cricket Field Lane. <br />&#8226; When the lane becomes Chapel Hill and begins to fall steeply, turn along a gravel lane to the left. Continue until it turns steeply down the hill past the delightful Umbrella Cottage. Take the steps down towards Dolphin Square and enjoy an ice-cream at The Creamery.</p>\n<p><strong>Maps:</strong> Visit the <a href=\"http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/getamap/\"

cookbook has been around my family a lot longer than I have. <em>At Home on the Range</em> was first published in 1947, back when my father &#151; now a gray-bearded man in flannel shirts &#151; was a towheaded toddler in droopy pants. The book was dedicated to my Aunt Nancy, whom the author described as a 5-year-old child already in possession of the \"two prime requisites of a good cook: a hearty appetite and a sense of humor.\"</p>\n<p>(Nancy is still in possession of both those fine qualities, I am happy to say, but she is now a grandmother.)</p>\n<p>The copy that I inherited belonged to my own grandmother, our beloved and long-gone Nini, whose penciled notes (\"Never apologize for your cooking!\") are still in the margins. The book was written by her mother &#151; my great-grandmother &#151; who was a cooking columnist for the <em>Baltimore Sun,</em> and who died of alcoholism long before I was born. Her name was Margaret Yardley Potter, but everyone in my family called her Gima, and until this year I had never read a word of her writing.</p>\n<p>Of course, I'd seen the book on family bookshelves, and I'd certainly heard the name Gima mentioned with love and longing, but I'd never actually opened the volume. I'm not sure why. Maybe I was busy. Maybe I didn't expect much from the writing: The original jacket photo shows a kindly white-haired woman with set curls and glasses, and maybe I thought the work would reflect that photo &#151; dated and ordinary, Jell-O and Spam. Or maybe I am just a fool, willing to travel the world in pursuit of magic and exoticism while ignoring more intimate marvels right here at home.</p>\n<p>All I can say is that I finally picked up Gima's cookbook last spring at the age of 41, when I found it at the bottom of a box, which I was finally unpacking because I was finally settling into the house where I hope and pray to finally stay put. I cracked it open and read it in one rapt sitting. No, that's not entirely true: I wasn't really sitting, or at least not for long. After the first few pages, I jumped up and dashed through the house to find my husband so I could read parts of it to him: \"Listen to this! The humor! The insight! The sophistication!\" Then I followed him around the kitchen while he was making our dinner (lamb shanks), and I continued reading aloud as we ate. Then the two of us sat for hours over the dirty dishes, finishing a bottle of wine and taking turns reading the book to each other by candlelight. By the end of the night, there were three of us sitting at that table. Gima had come to join us, and she was wonderful, and I was in love.</p>\n<p>What you have to understand about my great-grandmother, first and foremost, is that she was born rich. Not stinkin' rich &#151; not Park Avenue rich, or Newport rich &#151; but late-19th-century Main Line Philadelphia rich, which was still pretty darn rich. I tend to forget that we ever had that strain of wealth and refinement in our family (it was long spent by the time I arrived), but &#151; decidedly unlike her descendants &#151; Gima grew up with sailboats and lawn tennis, white linens and Irish servants, social registers and debutante balls.</p>\n<p>The young Margaret Yardley was not a beauty. That would've been her little sister, Elizabeth (for whom I was named). A family visitor, introduced to both girls when they were in their teens, let his eyes rest on my great-grandmother and said, \"Well, you must be the one who cooks.\" Well, yes, she was the one who cooked &#151; and she also happened to be the charming and popular one. With such nice credentials, she probably could've married just about anyone. For reasons lost to history, she chose to marry my great-grandfather Sheldon Potter &#151; a charismatic Philadelphia lawyer full of brains and temper and narcissism who was witty but lacerating, sentimental but unfaithful; who'd passed the bar at age 19 and could quote Herodotus in Greek, but who never developed a taste for work. (As one relative later diagnosed him, \"He was too heavy for light work, and too light for heavy work.\")</p>\n<p>Sheldon Potter did, however, develop a taste for fine living and serious overspending. As a result, Gima slid deeper and deeper into reduced circumstances with every year of her life. As she relays (uncomplainingly!) in the first pages of her cookbook, over the course of her marriage she was \"shuttled financially and physically between a twelve-room house in the suburbs, a four-room shack in the country, numerous summer cottages, and a small city apartment.\" She passed the lean years of World War II on \"an isolated and heatless farm on Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" which was probably the furthest imaginable cry from her classy Edwardian upbringing.</p>\n<p>Listen, she made the best of it. For one thing, her financial troubles were not entirely Sheldon's fault. Gima was quite the spendthrift herself, and she faced life with a Jazz Age sensibility that can best be summed up in one gleeful, reckless, consequences-be-damned word: \"Enjoy!\" Moreover, she had an instinct for bohemian living &#151; maybe even a preference for it &#151; and that instinct informs the winningly informal tone of <em>At Home on the Range. </em>While she admits, for instance, that \"there is no substitute for either good food or a comfortable bed,\" she submits that pretty much everything else in the material world can be substituted for, or improvised, or gone without, or cobbled together from junk-store treasures. Books can be borrowed, wildflowers can be picked from roadside ditches, barrels can be transformed into perfectly good little tables, orange crates make excellent chairs, cheap onions can replace expensive shallots without anyone's tasting the difference, and there's no need whatsoever to be ashamed of a kitchen that resembles \"an old-fashioned tin peddler's cart.\"</p>\n<p>All your guests really need from you, Gima assures us, is your warm welcome, plenty of good food, and a steady supply of ice for cocktails. Provide that, she promises, and \"a world of friends will beat a path to your door.\" So she did provide, and so a world of friends did beat a path to her door, but it should not necessarily be inferred that her life was easy just because her houseguests adored her.</p>\n<p>Married to a man whom my father describes as \"impossible,\" constantly in debt (sometimes slipping out of foreclosed homes just ahead of the sheriff's arrival), struggling with the alcoholism that would periodically land her in psychiatric clinics and grim hospital wards, my creative but constrained great-grandmother was not the first or the last woman in the history of female hardship to take refuge in food.</p>\n<p>Or rather, I should say, she took refuge both in food and in writing, because the voice that emerges on these pages is a literary delight as well as a culinary one. Gima doesn't just list her recipes here; she <em>tells</em> her recipes, with a wit and self-confidence that makes her sound like a cross between Dorothy Parker and M.F.K. Fisher. (Don't overthink orange marmalade, she assures us in one typically bright passage: \"Constant stirring and average intelligence is really all that's necessary.\")</p>\n<p>Gima was also a food sensualist, a quality all too often missing in American cookbooks from that era. Not only does she carefully explain how to bake a perfect loaf of bread, but she adds just as the loaf is coming out of the oven: \"And if you can resist cutting off a big warm piece and spreading it thickly with butter, you're not the girl I think.\" But what strikes me most, reading Gima's cookbook, is that she was so far ahead of her time.</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a

Yet two out of three of us never tell our doctors, and those who do speak up have waited, on average, 6.5 years. Instead, we cross our legs with every sneeze, scope out the fastest route to the toilet at parties, and hope for the aisle seat at movies and on airplanes.</p>\n<p>\"Talking about it can be embarrassing,\" says urogynecologist Sharon Knight, M.D., at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Or women think it's an inevitable consequence of childbearing and aging and that nothing can be done.\"</p>\n<p>If that's you, here's the headline: Women's biggest urinary problems are all treatable.

Observing their glassy-eyed stares, it's hard not to wonder (and worry), <em>What is this screen time doing to their development?</em></p>\n<p>We've all heard the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics: just one to two hours a day of \"quality\" electronic entertainment for children over 2. Yeah, right. In 2010, a study in the<em> American Journal of Epidemiology</em> reported that most adolescents spend an average of 25 to 30 hours per week watching TV and using computers. And while half of parents surveyed in a 2010 study said they always or often set limits on screen time, 18 percent of their kids really disagreed.</p>\n<p>\"It's getting more complicated to measure how much screen time kids are getting,\" notes Lisa Guernsey, author of <em>Into the Minds of Babes,</em> a book about children's use of electronic media. \"We're no longer talking about the TV in the den that parents can turn off. These days, many teens and tweens have smartphones, laptops, tablets, and iPods that they carry with them.\" When you add up the total time kids spend on their electronic devices, you arrive at a truly staggering number: The average American between the ages of 8 and 18 spends more than seven hours a day looking at a screen of some kind, reports a Kaiser Family Foundation study. \"When we conducted a similar survey five years before, we thought children's screen time couldn't rise any higher,\" says Donald F. Roberts, Ph.D., a Stanford University communications professor who coauthored the study. \"But it just keeps going up and up.\"</p>\n<p>Scientists are now beginning to tease out the effects of all this electronic engagement. Too much screen time may be linked to an increased incidence of risky behaviors, and more social network activity seems to correspond to mood problems among teens. But there's good news, too. Moderate computer use may be associated with the development of some cognitive and social skills.

can I lose weight when I'm so busy with work, my kids and housework? I feel like I have no time to eat right&#151;or sometimes even eat at all! What can I do? ","__total_count__":3,"sender":"Amy Turner","answer":"I can relate, and for busy people like us, planning is key. Make a master list of three convenient, diet-friendly breakfasts (such as 1 cup whole-grain cereal with skim milk and a banana, or a whole-grain English muffin topped with peanut butter and apple); lunches (such as turkey, lettuce, tomato and mustard on a whole-grain sandwich thin with baby carrots); several dinners (such as grilled chicken topped with marinara sauce and lowfat mozzarella with a side of steamed broccoli) and snacks (veggies, whole fruit, nonfat yogurt) for the afternoon or your commute home. Commit the list to memory&#151;and make sure you have all the ingredients for these meals and snacks in the house at all times so they'll become your automatic go-tos. "},{"question":"How much sugar is OK in your daily food intake?","__total_count__":3,"sender":"Ann Bernhard","answer":"<p>First, know that there are two types of sugar: natural and added. Natural sugars are found mostly in fruit and unsweetened dairy products like milk and plain yogurt. Don't worry about limiting natural sugar from these items, since they also have vitamins, minerals and fiber. But note that dried fruit and 100% fruit juice have much more concentrated amounts of sugar, so I do advise limiting these, particularly if you have diabetes or a weight issue.</p>\n\n<p>As for added sugars that sweeten packaged foods&#151;including cane sugar, honey, maple syrup, evaporated cane juice, agave, molasses and brown rice syrup&#151;less is always better, no matter what kind it is. The American Heart Association advises that women have fewer than 100 calories&#151;about 6 tsp&#151;from added sugar daily. (Every gram of added sugar equals 4 calories.) But these guidelines are hard to follow, since added sugars aren't specified on nutrition labels. \"Sugars\" are listed under \"Total Carbohydrate,\" but this refers to added and natural. Instead, I recommend sticking to these rules most of the time to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet:</p>\n\n<p>Avoid soda and sugary drinks.</p>\n\n<p>Limit the amount of sugar, honey and other sweeteners you add to foods and drinks to 3 tsp daily.</p>\n\n<p>Choose packaged foods with minimal sugar. I suggest cereals with no more than 8 g per serving and yogurts with no more than 20 g per container.</p>\n\n<p>If you crave sweets, allow yourself a 150-calorie treat daily or a decadent dessert once or twice a week. My favorites balance sugar with something healthy, such as a scoop of ice cream (high in calcium), 1 oz dark chocolate (packed with antioxidants), or berries (loaded with fiber and vitamin C) with a dollop of whipped cream.</p>"},{"question":"How soon after you\nwake up should you eat\nbreakfast?

Using two Aventadors, four Gallardos, and two Gallardo Superleggeras (all with studded tires,) instructors convey rally-style car control techniques despite the inherent challenge of taming these high-horsepower, stiffly sprung sports cars. As I learned on my first day in the snow, Lambos are considerably trickier to wrangle in slippery conditions than, say, a Subaru STi, whose&#160;compliant suspension enables more communicative transfers of weight.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>With the electronic nannies off, sliding these bad boys across ice is like wrestling a hyperactive ninja, requiring delicate throttle stabs and swift countersteers. The Aventador LP700-4's wide berth and 691 horsepower engine oozed a bit too much vigor for our tight course-though its electronically controlled Haldex differential was better equipped at routing torque to the front wheels than the Gallardo's rear-biased setup. My favorite? The taut but drift happy Superleggera, which offered the best steering feedback and most responsive dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The next three-day program runs in Mongolia this March, includes high-end accommodations, and will set you back &#8364;5,950 (around $7,800)-- pricey for me and you, but probably chump change for the average Lambo owner.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For more, go to <a href=\"http://www.lamborghiniacademy.com/#home\">lamborghiniacademy.com</a>.</p>\n<p><!--EndFragment--></p>"}],"blog_author":""}],"article_type_name":"Blog Entry Lite","publish_date":"2012-03-05T14:29:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Wasef","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"basemw-blog","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":null,"article_type_prefix":"blog_entry_lite","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6826583","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/cars/news/shows/4292519\">2009 Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4 Spyder: Hot-Blooded 201 mph Italian Exotic Convertible: Live From the 2008 LA Auto Show</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/reviews/drives/2012-lamborghini-aventador-lp-700-4-test-drive\">2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Test Drive</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/4285613\">Top 10 Exotic and Luxury Cars From the 2008 Paris Motor Show</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/jay-leno/4253461\">Jay Leno Drives Street-Legal Go-Kart, Lightweight Sports Cars </a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/4292807\">2008 Los Angeles Auto Show: Are Exotic Cars Recession-Proof?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/news/4231245\">2008 Lamborghini Revent&Atilde;&sup3;n Test Drive: L.A.

It focuses primarily on the lives of the women who wait at home while the menfolk go off to war, while smartly acknowledging this isn't the same situation we had back in the Middle Ages or the Civil War. Women go off into battle, too, for starters (Sterling K. Brown, above, is an Army \"husband\"). We've had some of the classic soapy stuff of women having affairs while their husbands were away, but the show's focal point has always been on the more complex elements of military relationships. That explains why it's still going strong into season six.]Sunday, 10 p.m. (A&amp;E) Breakout Kings We've got a couple of shows now where criminals team up with the good guys. \"Leverage.\" \"White Collar.\" But none of the others looks like \"Breakout Kings,\" where four prison inmates agree to help track down other cons in hopes of getting their sentences reduced. It's a dangerous game, and the inmates are a well-drawn lot. They have multiple problems even beyond being criminals, yet we root for them to increase the small, tenuous grip they have on their path back.]Tuesday, 8 p.m. (Ch. 13) Oscar Hammerstein II: Out of My Dreams You gotta have some powerful cards to even get into the discussion of the 20th century's great lyricists, and it's a tribute to Oscar Hammerstein that no one even needs to look at his ID. Just think \"Oklahoma,\" \"South Pacific,\" \"The Sound of Music\" and \"The King and I\"  you know, shows like that. He could be prickly to work with, but the results were worth whatever it cost, and this show wisely sticks to what mattered most, the songs that will be sung as long as humans have working lips.]Wednesday, 10 p.m. (BRV) Million Dollar Listing New York Bravo some time ago realized the one thing that does not go down during a real-estate deflation is our voyeuristic interest in what houses and property cost. So whether New York is still feeling some of the implosion of the last few years or whether it's really rebounding, Bravo comes out a winner. Having a New York show is also a no-brainer because in the right neighborhoods of New York, a \"million-dollar listing\" could be 400 square feet. Real-estate shows are only partly about real estate, of course, but both the human and the financial parts of this one should be interesting.]Saturday, 5:30 p.m. (TCM) \"The Grapes of Wrath\" If you have never seen this movie, you should. If you have seen it, maybe it's time to see it again, because it's that good. It's based on John Steinbeck's novel about the Depression and how some powers inside the system tried to grind down anyone who stood up for basic fairness. Henry Fonda (l., with Jane Darwell) plays the guy who stood up, and once you've seen his Tom Joad, you won't forget him.

Maybe a little too quiet if you're ABC, which has been getting free publicity ever since it announced last spring it was greenlighting the show originally called \"Good Christian Bitches.\" While no one at the network phrased it this way, ABC silently hoped from the start that a little righteous outrage would help stoke general public curiosity. \"We would love to have people go, you know, there's something here edgy and interesting that we'd like to be part of,\" says ABC Entertainment President Paul Lee. A number of women's groups and religious groups said last spring that no, they weren't really interested in being a part of it. They have been less vocal lately, perhaps in part because the b-word is no longer an official part of the title.\"The idea of calling it 'Good Christian Bitches' was not something that seemed to settle at first,\" says Robert Harling, who created the show. \"Then 'Good Christian Belles' popped up. But 'belles' is not exactly accurate for the Texas environment. Belles is more of skirts and Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia and not so much Texas.\" Then \"GCB\" came up. \"I looked at it and thought, that's really cool,\" says Harling, \"like LOL and ROFL and BTW. So 'GCB' just kind of stuck.\" Lest anyone suspect this took \"bitches\" off the table, however, ABC's promos for the show have done everything except use the actual word. The promos say \"Good Christian ...\" and then show a snippet that suggests there may be no other word that could describe the behavior. \"I think the promo campaign will pique people's interest,\" says Lee. He adds that \"bitch\" \"is not a word we can use in broadcast for our titles.\" Still, it's one of the loudest carnival barkers outside the tent, trying to get viewers to poke their heads inside. Even if they do, of course, they won't stick around unless they like what they see - and ABC wants a lot of people to like it a lot. If ABC's wish were to come true - and a company owned by Disney presumably knows all about the \"when you wish upon a star\" business - \"GCB\" would become the kind of solid Sunday-night anchor that \"Desperate Housewives\" has provided for the last six or seven years. Since Sunday is the most-watched night of television, it's hard to overestimate how important it is for a network to have at least one show that viewers will make a point of watching. ABC had hoped before this season that the stylish \"Pan Am\" might fill that role, but with \"Pan Am\" now flying off into the sunset, \"GCB\" has become heir to the vision. Like \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"GCB\" is a deliberately overblown soap with a constant wink. It's also built around a cast of women.Amanda Vaughn (Leslie Bibb) serves as the initial catalyst, because 20 years ago she was the queen of the Dallas high school they all attended. Pretty and popular, Amanda was also a total, well, bitch. There hasn't been a high-school drama in the last 15 years without a \"mean girl\" or two, and Amanda apparently was a prototype. When we first meet her, though, she's sympathetic. She and her husband, who she stole from one of the other girls, moved to Los Angeles 18 years ago. They married, had two kids, made a pile of money. Life was idyllic.Except it turned out he was Bernie Madoff West. He was also killed in a car crash, driving with a woman who wasn't Amanda. Broke and ostracized, Amanda must do what she swore she would never do, move back to Dallas and live with her rich, self-absorbed mother, Gigi Stopper (Annie Potts).  Within minutes, she starts running into the old high-school crowd she ran over and left for dead in the ditch. This includes Carlene (Kristin Chenoweth), Sharon (Jennifer Aspen), Cricket (Miriam Shor) and Heather (Marisol Nichols).  These women are in the \"Desperate Housewives\" socioeconomic league. Not super-rich, but living nice, comfortable suburban lives. They also attend church regularly. Carlene sings in the choir. They don't always adhere to all the urgings of the New Testament, however, like the parts about kindness and not being judgmental and forgiving seven times 70. It's this gap between their public piety and their private struggles with their lower selves that made \"GCB\" a book and now makes it a TV show. When Amanda goes to church with her mother and sees Carlene in the choir, she almost gasps.\"She's had some work done,\" says Gigi. \"Work?\" says Amanda. \"That's a teardown.\" It gets a lot bitchier than that. The Dallas four pull strings, for instance, to ensure no one will give Amanda a job.  So she signs up to waitress in a Hooters-style bar and, well, you see where \"GCB\" will be going.\"Where we're similar to 'Desperate Housewives' is it's a story about a group of women,\" says Bibb. \"But nobody writes for Southern women the way that Bobby Harling writes. I have never seen a show like this.\" \"To be compared to a show that's one of the biggest hits in the history of television,\" Harling says, \"yeah, I would love to eventually be compared to that. \"But I think if you just look at the two shows, the fabulous thing about 'Desperate Housewives' is it's universal. It could be happening everywhere. [We] create a world that's very specific. Our world could only take place in Texas and only in Dallas and only in a particular part of Dallas.\"Now it's just a matter of getting the rest of the country as interested in this drama as it was in \"Dallas,\" which, by the way, is coming back itself this summer. But Chenoweth says you don't go into a show thinking big thoughts about promotional and viewership expectations, or whether you're offending anybody by invoking, explicitly or implicitly, the b-word. What you do think about, she says, is the world you're creating and the characters in it. \"All these people, their problems are real to them,\" she says. \"The big barbecue, the affair, the this, the that, they're real problems. And it's fun to just be able to say, 'Ooh, bad hair day.'\"It's just fun, you know.\""}],"article_type_name":"News Article","publish_date":"2012-03-04T05:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":"VCOV4F_555767","template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"webuser","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":null,"article_type_prefix":"news","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"6937564","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1011","last_updated_date":"2012-02-28T22:10:12.000Z","author_id":"8457","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"newsconsortium","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2022-02-28T22:10:12.000Z","origin_site_name":"News Consortium","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.newsconsortium.com/news-vcov4f_555767-fc4460fc625811e1924ede522a9347ce","issue_date":null,"contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"566","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://newsconsortium.hearstdigital.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"dough","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":null,"related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"581","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"566","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"news-treat19f_555195-fffa087c5f1611e1a66dababed28a9cb","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-02-24T18:40:18.000Z","title":"dough","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":null,"allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"1","active":"Y","site_id":"566","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"sragan","last_name":"Unknown","email":null,"creation_date":"2009-05-20T20:20:43.000Z","id":"8457","last_updated_date":"2009-05-20T20:20:43.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Unknown"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":[{"images":"","byline":"PATTY LEE","category":[{"__total_count__":1,"category":"FEATURES"}],"storytext":"By Patty Lee new york daily news Kim Ima is bringing her homey desserts straight to your kitchen.

United Russia, the ruling party and the political instrument by which Vladimir Putin (and, nominally, Dmitry Medvedev) has exercised total control over the state for the past twelve years, was supposed to get about 74 percent at each voting station; the Communist party, the always-second main rival of UR, was supposed to get around 20 percent. And so they do in most of the district, except where heads of several voting commissions give 74 percent to the Communists and 20 percent to UR. The only reasonable explanation: They mixed up their instructions, attributed the wrong percentages to the wrong parties, and revealed that the fix was in from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>Weird things happen all over the country. In Chechnya, according to official results, voter attendance is 99.5 percent, and yet according to the preelection polls, more than 60 percent of the people in the republic said they never or almost never vote. In Moscow, two voting stations in the same school report vastly different findings &#151; one has 90 percent for United Russia, the other only 26 percent. Independent observers in Russia's capital who weren't removed from voting stations tell incredible stories about election officials who escape the stations with bags full of ballots &#151; never to be seen at the station again. Ilya Azar, a correspondent for the news site Lenta.ru, manages to go undercover with two other journalists to reveal a fraud scheme called the \"merry-go-round\": People are hired to go around to several voting stations with falsified absentee ballots, and with the help of local election commissions, they stuff the ballot boxes. This is either the sloppiest case of election rigging in history or proof that some acts of fraud are simply too massive to succeed.</p>\n<p>By nightfall it becomes clear that United Russia will carry the day and retain control of parliament, but by a much slimmer margin than anybody expected. People start to read about allegations of fraud and abuse. On blogs. On Facebook. They watch videos on YouTube that document ballot stuffing. They question whether United Russia would have prevailed in a free and fair election. They question how far Putin and Medvedev will go to stay in power. And for the first time in a long time, some of them decide to do something about it.</p>\n<p><strong>DECEMBER 5:</strong> Thousands of people, perhaps as many as ten thousand, gather in the center of Moscow, on Chistoprudny Boulevard, to protest election fraud. It is the largest gathering of protesters in a decade, and among them is Alexei Navalny, a lawyer, political activist, and blogger who became famous last year when he branded United Russia \"the party of crooks and thieves.\" Navalny gets up onstage and makes a speech, most notable for the remark: \"They call us little hamsters from the social networks. Yes, I am a little network hamster! And I'll gnaw through the throats of these cads!\" &#151; meaning the regime. \"It was clear that we couldn't just stand there for a while and leave,\" says Navalny. \"We needed some act of civil disobedience that said: We exist. So some people decided to go to the Central Election Commission building, which was about a mile away. The first couple of cordons were pretty easy to pass &#151; internal troops, silly little soldiers with their silly shields: You push him, and he either falls down or steps aside. But then came the OMON, special-purpose police units. Those guys are pretty big and well trained, they stand in two rows, and they know how to hit you &#151; first a real tricky one with a knee, then with their helmet. I got one right on my nose. If you want to break a cordon like that, you must have tenfold the people, which we actually had, but we were too spread out.

No, we don&#8217;t mean skin-light lycra shorts or wind-resistant tops. It&#8217;s the first layer that really matters. That&#8217;s right &#8211; your bra. Get the right one and you can confidently run (or volley, jump, or box) your way to a great body, without damaging your breasts as you go.</p>\n<p>That might sound crazy, but the very things you do to tone and improve the rest of your body can be doing the opposite to your boobs if you&#8217;re not supporting them. You probably know that there are no muscles in our breasts (if there were we&#8217;d have boob-gyms instead of have uplift bras and implants!). Our breasts are actually held in shape by delicate ligaments, and once they have been stretched beyond their limit no amount of toning exercises can improve them.</p>\n<p>You might think that your normal bra is going to do the job when you work out but it&#8217;s just not true. Did you know that a <a href=\"http://www.shockabsorber.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Shock Absorber</a> sports bra is <strong>twice as effective</strong> at preventing bounce as your everyday bra that you might be wearing at the gym? What&#8217;s more, sports bras are designed to help you get the most from your workout, with shaped, padded straps that won&#8217;t keep falling down and performance fabrics that make sure you stay cooler and drier.</p>\n<p>Get the right sports bra and you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever managed without it.</p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s time to get your hands on one of the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.shockabsorber.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Shock Absorber</a> sports bras. These exercise-essentials can reduce bounce by up to a whopping 78%*</p>\n<p>Made from moisture-wicking, breathable, sports performance fabrics, they&#8217;ll also keep you super comfortable as you workout. If you are a runner you definitely need the <strong>Ultimate Run Bra</strong>, which includes a seamless inner to reduce friction, and padded no-slip straps. Like a bit of shape and oomph? Go for the <strong>Sports Padded Bra</strong>; removable pads and a soft, non-rub hook and eye fastening make this stylish sports bra a popular choice.</p>\n<p>Those of you who like lower-cut tops, or just want to feel cooler &#8211; will love the <strong>Sports Plunge Bra</strong>, with its plunging front mesh panel for extra cooling and sleek racer back for ease of movement (a great yoga piece). If you do a variety of sports you will want the <strong>Multi-Sports Support Bra</strong>, it looks like a crop top so you can wear it under your gym kit or on its own, but it&#8217;s super supportive thanks to an inner bra construction. And it goes up to a HH cup too!</p>\n<p>Still not sure which sports bra is for you?

Keep your chest up, pull your shoulders back and look straight ahead as you lift the bar, keeping it close to your legs. Focus on taking the weight back onto your heels (rather than your toes). Lift to thigh level, pause, then return very slowly to the start position.</p>\n<p>Be sure to ask a personal trainer or gym instructor to check your technique and form if you&#146;re unsure.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the</strong> <strong>box jump</strong> Stand in front of a sturdy, secure box that requires a high-effort jump. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart. Leap up onto the box with a soft landing. Step down and reset your feet. If you find the move too challenging, reduce the jump height or step up rather than jump.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 1: Barbell bench press and hand-release press-up supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the barbell bench press</strong> Lie flat on the bench with your eyes underneath the bar. Grab it with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Take a deep breath, tighten your core, then exhale and press the bar from the rack until your arms are fully extended. Pause at the top for a second, take another deep breath, hold it, then lower until the barbell touches your chest. Exhale and drive the bar back to the top phase of the movement. Repeat.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the hand-release press-up</strong> Lie flat on the floor, face down, with your hands placed shoulder-width apart at chest height. Take a deep breath, then exhale as you push up away from the floor until your arms are fully extended. Your body should be straight from shoulders to ankles. Lower to the floor until you&#146;re in the start position, lift your hands away from the floor. And repeat.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 2: Overhead tricep press and tricep dip supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the overhead tricep press</strong> This exercise mimics the movement of a football throw in. Stand facing away from a cable column, grab the rope/bar with an overhand grip, and hold it behind your head. Step forward with one foot to provide support and bend your body forward at your hip to ana ngle of about 30 degrees. This is your start position. You should now be able to push forward with your forearms until your arms are fully extended and parallel with the floor. Maintain an upward gaze with your elbows narrow and pointing forward throughout. Return under control to the start position. And repeat.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the tricep dip</strong> Place your hands on two parallel bars and lift yourself up so your shoulders are directly above your hands with your chest is raised. Lower your body under control until your shoulders are lower than the elbows &#150; or as far as your flexibility allows. Then push back up to the start position. Keep your eyes and chest up throughout the movement. Assistance from a machine (which you place your knees on) or a training partner can be used if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 3: Pec deck and box jumps supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to use the pec deck</strong> Sit up straight with your back and head rested against the pec deck bench (it&#146;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMox1eEp5E\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>). When holding the two handles with arms outstretched to your sides, your upper arms should be angled very slightly lower than horizontal, with your forearms and fists facing towards the ceiling &#150; almost forming a right angle with the rest of your arm. From here, squeeze your elbows together until they make contact, pause for a second, then very slowly allow them to return to the start position. Keep your head up throughout.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the box jump</strong> See above.</p>\n<h2>Fat Burner: Rowing machine intervals</h2>\n<p><strong>Tabata row</strong> Row as fast as you can for 20 seconds. Recover for 10 seconds. Repeat for eight rounds.</p>\n<h2>Workout B</h2>\n<p><strong>Muscles targeted</strong> Back and biceps</p>\n<h2>Warm-up move: Back squat and tricep press-up supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the squat</strong> Approach the squat rack with the bar set to upper chest height. With your feet shoulder-width apart and toes facing slightly outwards, grip the barbell with a slightly&#160;<em></em>wider than shoulder-width grip. Crouch down to place your shoulders underneath the bar and push up to dismount it from the rack. Take a deep breath in, keeping your core very tight, and lower your hips back and down until they are at least as low as your knees. Push back to the start position along the same path. Ensure your heels are flat on the floor, your knees are pointing outward, your back is straight, and your chest is up at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the tricep press-up </strong>Lie flat on the floor, face down, with your hands positioned so your index fingers and thumbs touch in a diamond shape below the centre of your chest. Take a deep breath, then exhale as you push up away from the floor until your arms are fully extended. Your body should be straight from shoulders to ankles. Lower until you are an inch from the floor. And repeat.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 1: Lat pull down and underarm pull up supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the lat pull down</strong> Sit facing the lat pull down station and grab the bar with an overhand wide grip. Keeping your head up and your back straight, pull the bar down and stick your chest out so that the bar touches (or comes close to touching) the top of your chest. Pause. Then slowly reverse the movement until your arms are fully extended. Repeat.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the underarm pull up</strong> Grab the bar with an underarm grip and pull upward until your chin reaches the top of the bar. Then slowly lower back down until your arms are fully extended. Repeat. If this is too difficult use an assisted machine, placing your knees on the platform.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 2: Barbell bicep curl and medicine-ball hammer curl supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the barbell bicep curl</strong> Stand holding a barbell using an underhand grip with the weight in contact with your thighs. Keep your arms tight to your body and bend at your elbows to curl the bar up until it makes contact with your chest. Pause and return very slowly to the start position. Be careful not to let your elbows creep forward as you curl the bar upwards.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the medicine-ball hammer curl</strong> Stand holding a medicine ball with your palms facing towards your body. Bend at your elbows, keeping your upper arms dead straight, to bring your forearms towards your shoulders. Flex hard at the top of the movement then lower back to the start position. Repeat.</p>\n<h2>Muscle builder 3: Seated row and bear walk supersets</h2>\n<p><strong>How to do the seated row</strong> Sit down with your feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be slightly bent, your back upright and your chest high. Tip forward at the hips and grasp the bar. Now pull back, bending your elbows and keeping them tight to your body. Very slowly return to the start position. Repeat.</p>\n<p><strong>How to do the bear walk</strong> Bend your knees until you are able to touch the floor with both hands. Now walk forward using your hands until you are in the top phase of a press-up. Pause here and return to the start position. Keep your abs tight and eyes looking upwards throughout the movement.</p>\n<h2>Fat burner: 10% incline treadmill tabata</h2>\n<p>Run as fast as you can for 20 seconds. Recover for 10 seconds.

An attack takes the candidate unawares. One adviser is on a plane and unreachable, while two others are feuding about whether to ignore the charge or beat it back. Meanwhile, the press is demanding answers and sounding alarms. The campaign is in free fall.</p>\n<p>It's for just these moments that a campaign keeps an enforcer on hand: someone fearless and unflappable, someone who will step up, take charge, and, if needed, take the blame. For President Barack Obama, that someone is Stephanie Cutter.</p>\n<p>Cutter, 43, a deputy campaign manager for Obama-Biden 2012, has been with the Obamas since 2008, when she started out as Michelle's chief of staff, and is one of the most respected communications strategists in Washington. \"Politics gets me out of bed in the morning,\" she tells <em>Marie Claire</em> at her office in Obama's Chicago re-election headquarters. \"It's what really interests me. I'm a competitor, but I also feel like I'm contributing, whether it's working on health-care policy in the White House or out here in Chicago.\"</p>\n<p>Having just moved out from Washington a week before, she is already knee-deep in the hour-to-hour mini crises that define campaign life. She doesn't get home to her newly rented apartment until 9 or 10 p.m. (Cutter is unmarried; her dog, a rescue named Sammy, has a dog walker.) She grabs a few hours' sleep, rises at 5 a.m., and gets in a quick workout. Then it all starts again.</p>\n<p>Asked how she's made it to the highest ranks of politics &#151; in 2012, still a boys' club packed with locker-room personalities &#151; Cutter demures. \"I have no idea how it happened,\" she says with a little laugh. \"I know I worked hard.\" (An associate, on the other hand, knows exactly how she did it: \"She's a bulldozer when she needs to be.\")</p>\n<p>Cutter grew up in a politically active family in Raynham, Massachusetts, where she and her two brothers were treated as equals. \"My brother got a .22 for his 12th birthday; I got a .22. He got a hunting knife; I got a hunting knife,\" Cutter says. Her attraction to public service goes back as long as she can remember. In high school, she canvassed the lunchroom for donations for the famine in Ethiopia. She graduated from Smith College, where she was also politically active. (Her college pal Julianna Smoot is one of two other deputy campaign managers for Obama.)</p>\n<p>After graduating, Cutter marched into the offices of New York Governor Mario Cuomo, an idol of hers who was considering a presidential run of his own, and cold-pitched his staff on hiring her. \"And that was my first job: answering his phones,\" she says. Soon she was promoted to speechwriter, and when Cuomo bowed out of the 1992 presidential race, she was snapped up by Bill Clinton's campaign.
