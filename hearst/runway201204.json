and whether we&#8217;re getting enough of it? In order to translate our wellbeing into something attainable, <em>MH</em> sought Professor Martin Seligman&#8217;s expertise. A psychologist specialising in the science behind the smile, he has broken happiness down into five constituent parts: positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment. We&#8217;re going to show you how you can get more of each. Happy hunting.</p>\n<h2>Get positive emotion on tap</h2>\n<p><strong>What we feel: pleasure, rapture, ecstasy, warmth, comfort</strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how Professor Seligman describes positivity in his book. But attention hippies: all-day cheer doesn&#8217;t work. Psychologists at North Carolina University calculated the optimum ratio of positive to negative statements by analysing how people spoke to each other. It&#8217;s 3:1. Anything above 3:1 and you lose credibility and become unproductive.</p>\n<p>To ensure the good times eclipse the bad, you need to plan more. Whether it&#8217;s a holiday, tomorrow&#8217;s steak dinner or golf on Sunday, research shows that you get a greater mental boost from planning something than you do from actually doing it.</p>\n<p>Finally, when good things do happen, make sure you notice. Call your partner to tell them or put an update on Facebook.</p>\n<h2>Feel more engaged</h2>\n<p><strong>This is about flow: time stopping, the loss of self-consciousness during an absorbing activity</strong></p>\n<p>The simplest way to achieve Seligman&#8217;s &#8216;flow&#8217; is to find out what you&#8217;re good at in different areas of life, then transfer those skills into new settings. If you&#8217;re a task-master at the office, you can also be &#8216;that guy&#8217; when organising a night out. If you&#8217;re a very empathetic friend, take on a mentoring role at work.</p>\n<p>You can manufacture engagement in the most humdrum of tasks by setting a challenge. Take the supermarket run: aim to beat your previous time each week, without missing items on your list.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade your relationships</h2>\n<p><strong>Little that is positive is solitary. Other people are the best antidote to the downs of life and the single most reliable up.</strong></p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/please-woman/improve-your-relationship-303613?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">get more from existing relationships</a> and build new ones quickly just by refining your conversation style. Psychologists at the University of California identified four response styles that we all use when reacting to good news from a friend or family member.</p>\n<p>The only one you need to know is &#8216;active constructive&#8217;. When somebody is pleased with something, probe them about it. Ask them for context: what made them happy, when did it happen, who were they with, what will they do next? This enthusiasm not only makes the other person feel good, but research shows it fosters a bond, and infectious good spirits, between you.</p>\n<h2>Search for the meaning of life</h2>\n<p><strong>Human beings, ineluctably, want purpose in life. This consists in belonging to and serving something you believe is bigger than yourself.</strong></p>\n<p>We have created all the institutions needed to achieve this: the family, political parties, religion, even the Leyton Orient Supporters Club. But perhaps the one that requires the most work is, well, work. The few people who describe their jobs as a &#8216;calling&#8217; claim to have more meaning in their lives than most.</p>\n<p>In order to reframe your job satisfaction, psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania say you should ask yourself these four key questions &#8211; then act on the answers:</p>\n<p><strong>Q1</strong> Draft an ideal version of your current job description. What new responsibilities would you like? <br /><strong>Q2</strong> How is this ideal different to the reality of your job? <br /><strong>Q3</strong> What would you stand to gain from making this change? <br /><strong>Q4</strong> What would enable you to achieve it?</p>\n<h2>Be a man of accomplishment</h2>\n<p><strong>Achievement is often pursued for its own sake, even when it brings no positive emotion</strong></p>\n<p>But, Seligman continues, that&#8217;s no bad thing. Getting things done is gratifying, whether learning a language or restoring a car.</p>\n<p>Create a table to map out achievements big and small from every decade of your life. Now select one from years back and pick it to pieces: what did you do well? How have you changed since and how can you recapture some of that old form? In the final column, write down what you want to achieve in the next 10 years.

Your belly was retreating and it all seemed worth the effort. Until, that is, everything stopped working. Sound familiar? It may not be down to a lack of willpower.</p>\n<p>The grim truth is that your body doesn&#8217;t like it when you lose a few pounds. In fact, it fights back. Research at the University of Melbourne found that dieting causes specific chemical changes that make you crave food. It can start when you&#8217;ve lost just 5% of your bodyweight. &#8220;There is a co-ordinated change in the blood hormones that regulate appetite,&#8221; says Professor Joseph Proietto, who ran the study. &#8220;This makes you hungry, and these changes are persistent for at least one year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This hormonal ambush is one of the big reasons that it&#8217;s hard to maintain steady weight loss. The good news is that by finding out what neurological changes are lurking beyond the next plate of grilled chicken and steamed veg, you can be ready. Follow this plan to pre-emptively spring every trap your body has set and you will escape fat for good.</p>\n<h2>Hunger strike! Ghrelin</h2>\n<p><em>Proietto&#8217;s study found that levels of the hunger-hormone ghrelin rise by 20% when you diet. Ghrelin is what triggers our urge to eat &#8211; useful as a survival mechanism but not when you're trying to shift fat.</em></p>\n<p>To get out of this one, carb-load at breakfast. Research from Tel Aviv University in Israel found this lowers your ghrelin levels for the whole day, avoiding any hunger pangs &#8211; even when you reduce your intake to just 1,600 calories. Skip the egg whites and start the day with beans on rye.</p>\n<p>After breakfast, the carb embargo should be reinstated, with extra protein brought in to increase satiety. At lunch, you can boost your intake by swapping brown rice for protein-rich quinoa or by adding a portion of Greek yoghurt for dessert.</p>\n<p>At dinner, skip the poultry a few nights a week and opt for sushi or a rare steak. The less that meat is cooked the more protein you absorb. A study in the <em>American Journal for Clinical Nutrition</em> found that if 60% of your plate is covered by high-protein foods, ghrelin levels will fall. The fight-back has started.</p>\n<h2>Empty threats! Leptin</h2>\n<p><em>As ghrelin attacks, your hormonal back-up retreats. The Melbourne study found that leptin, the chemical which suppresses your hunger, practically disappears.</em></p>\n<p>To bring leptin back, plan to have a strategic calorie blow-out &#8211; but only one. Research at the University of Washington found that after a period of fasting, a &#8216;re-feed&#8217; can reset levels of the hormone to where they were before you started. Good old fish and chips comes close to being the perfect cheat meal. The carbs in the potato will boost leptin quickly and a study by the Mayo Clinic found that a fish-rich diet increases your leptin sensitivity. This means your body &#8216;listens&#8217; to its message &#8211; ie the one that says you've had enough food.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still concerned that you&#8217;ve had enough food the message is getting lost, try to increase your duvet time. Studies conducted at Chicago University found that <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/more-energy/bedtime-snacks-for-better-sleep?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">sleep deprivation</a> can increase leptin levels by 20%.</p>\n<h2>The fat hack! Dopamine</h2>\n<p><em>This next threat is especially insidious. University of California research found that the moment any fatty food touches your tongue, your brain gives the signal to eat. And eat. And eat some more.</em></p>\n<p>Now&#8217;s the time for a nutritional triple-cross. You need to convince your grey matter that the food in your slim-down diet is just as moreish as fat by increasing the tyrosine in your diet &#8211; bananas, almonds and avocado are good sources. &#8220;Tyrosine is required for dopamine production,&#8221; says clinical nutritionist Kim Pearson. &#8220;Dopamine controls the brain&#8217;s reward centres, so when we increase our tyrosine intake we feel more satisfified by our food.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Curb compulsive snacking by eating mindfully. This will create a psychological distance between you and your impulses. At mealtimes, concentrate on different aspects of your food in turn. Register the smell, taste and texture. Be as forensic as you can and you&#8217;ll learn to recognise when you&#8217;re genuinely hungry &#8211; and when you just think you are.</p>\n<p><br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/tomato-escape-2504.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>The power cut! Metabolism</h2>\n<p><em>When you&#8217;ve been dieting for a while, your metabolism will slow down drastically: you can end up burning 300kcal less per day. If you were relying on calorie calculators, this practically disables them as your muscles have to work harder to burn off the food you&#8217;re eating.</em></p>\n<p>The workout below, created for <em>MH</em> by PT Darren Putt of Motus Training, has been designed specifically to bring your metabolism back online by targeting the largest muscles in your body. The more muscle mass you have, the greater your basal metabolic rate (BMR). &#8220;If you perform this routine with 15-rep-max weights then your cardiovascular system will get a challenging workout, too &#8211; similar to if you&#8217;d been slogging on the treadmill,&#8221; Putt says.</p>\n<p>Back this up by ensuring you have a minimum of 1.5g of protein for every kilo of your ideal body weight on training days, Pearson says. So if your target weight is 80kg, you need 120g of protein. Trap sprung.</p>\n<h2>How to escape your plateau</h2>\n<h4>Perform twice a week when your weight loss starts levelling out</h4>\n<p><br /><strong>Cardio work</strong> Keep it <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/cardio-exercise/3-high-intensity-workouts-to-burn-fat-and-increase-fitness?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">short and intense</a>. Try sprint sessions on grass wearing football boots. Warm up, then do 8 x 20m sprints at 75% effort. After each sprint, walk to the start and immediately go again.

That's why Atlanta-based decorator Phoebe Howard (known to her devoted fans across the South simply as \"Mrs. Howard\") always asks, \"How can I make the most luxurious, comfortable, restful place &#151; like the best hotel room you've ever been in, times 10?\"</p>\n<p>The dream-inducing rooms seen here &#151; from Howard's first book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584799617/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1584799617&linkCode=as2&tag=goodhousekeeping-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Joy of Decorating</em></a> &#151; all share a few calling cards: soothing palettes, layers of pattern and texture, noteworthy beds, and carpeting underfoot.

whatever speaks to you is the way you should go.\" Howard's personal favorite is the soothing, barely-there shade of blue-gray shown on the next slide.</p>\n<p>Then, remember not to clutter it up too much. \"In a bedroom, you're looking for peace and quiet,\" says Howard. \"Every morning, I want to open my eyes and love what I see.\"</p>","slide_title":"Sweet Dreams","custom_slide_links":[{"slide_links":[{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"/home/decorating-ideas/easy-room-fixup-0204","link_thumb_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/C6/kitchen17-s3-small_new.jpg","link_title":"9 Fast and Easy Decorating Ideas ","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"/home/decorating-ideas/decor-ideas-living-room#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/dE/Living-Room-Decor-Gallery-3-th2.jpg","link_title":"Living Room Decorating Ideas ","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"/home/decorating-ideas/furniture-made-in-usa#slide-1","link_thumb_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/hz/0712-living-room-decor-smn.jpg","link_title":"American-Made Home Decor ","link_text":""},{"link_sponsor_hex":"","link_sponsor":"No","__total_count__":4,"link_url":"/home/decorating-ideas/decor-ideas-master-bedroom","link_thumb_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/dP/Bedroom-Decor-Gallery-26-smn.jpg","link_title":"50+ Bedroom Decorating Inspirations ","link_text":""}],"__total_count__":1,"link_heading":"More Home Decor Ideas "}],"slide_credit":"Josh Gibson","slide_links_type":"Custom","sponsorship":"Nothing","slide_type":"Image"}],"article_type_name":"Flip Book 3","publish_date":"2012-08-13T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1528445","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20442","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/Gw/0612-neutral-bedroom-colors-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"akwan","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"flipbook3","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372759","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/home/decorating-ideas/decor-ideas-master-bedroom\">Master Bedroom Decorating Ideas </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/ideas-for-bedroom-decorating\">Bedded Bliss: Ideas for Bedroom Decorating </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/cozy-bedroom-decor\">Cozy Bedroom Decor Ideas </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/decorating-ideas/decor-ideas-kids-bedroom\">Kid's Bedroom Decor </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/budget-bedroom-makeover\">Make Over Your Bedroom on a Shoestring</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/decorating-ideas/decorating-ideas-master-bedroom\">Decorating Ideas for the Master Bedroom </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/decorating-ideas/bedroom-quick-fixes\">3 Quick Fixes for Any Bedroom </a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/home-decor-gallery\">Home Decor Gallery</a><br>\n<a href=\"/syndication/peaceful-bedrooms_synd\">What's Happening In Your Bedroom ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/decorating-ideas/easy-room-fixup-0204\">9 Fast and Easy Decorating Ideas </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1365","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:40:22.000Z","author_id":"37682","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/decorating-ideas/cozy-bedroom-decor","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"We got real dudes to hook you up with secrets to get in good with his buddies.

the Dell XPS 13, you won't have to sacrifice power for portability, making it our <b>favorite of the new ultrabook class</b>. This sub-three-pound wonder turned in the best scores in our performance testing, tackling our benchmark software handily. The Dell XPS 13 will be zippy if you're just using it for basic computing and, with its excellent high-definition graphics capabilities and powerful Intel processor, this system should be equipped to handle more intensive tasks like video and photo editing too. Even better, the ultrabook turned in the best battery life in our test handily, lasting upwards of 5 hours in between charges under our test conditions (We try to simulate how most people use the system in real life, so our tests are often more strenuous than those manufacturers use to quote battery life!). It's quick to start too, booting up in an impressively short 15 seconds (and coming back even quicker from sleep mode). Our consumer testers were big fans of this stylish Dell as well, giving it the highest scores of the bunch for usability. In particular, they praised the responsive track pad and found the keyboard comfortable to type on. Like much of its class, the Dell is compact and fairly light at just under 3 pounds. The downside to that slim profile? We found this PC is more prone to tip over backward in a lap than others, so keep a good grip if you're working with the computer on your lap.

is something I&#146;ve never been. You might say I&#146;m &#145;plump&#146;. I would probably go with &#145;stocky&#146; but we&#146;d both be wrong. Because the truth is that I&#146;m overweight. Not dangerously so, yet enough that I&#146;ve been on a diet or two. I&#146;ve had some success <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/daily-carb-cutting-meal-plan\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"How to cut carbs\">cutting carbs</a> and counting calories but there has always been something I couldn&#146;t stomach; that the seemingly spurious rules of one diet are better than another. Why cabbage soup over grapefruit, or Atkins instead of Dukan? Most diets seemed like a bit of a... fad. So, after a week or two, I would quit. And my plump stockiness would remain.</p>\n\n<p>But a new weight-loss programme, now available in the UK, promises to be more scientifically sound than any other. It is a diet built on a customer-by-customer basis and designed to match the most unique thing about each and every one of us &#150; our genetic code.</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/blue-jt-diet-2604.jpg\" /><br /><br />\n\n<p>The Nordiska Diet &#150; known as &#145;the DNA diet&#146; &#150; is founded on the emerging field of nutrigenomics, which is the study of how food interacts with your genes. Its creator, Newcastle-based company <a href=\"http://www.mygenomics.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">MyGenomics</a>, makes two confident claims on the website: firstly, that the plan will double your weight-loss potential compared to other diets; secondly, that the matching of your nutrition to your DNA has been proven to work for nine out of 10 people.</p>\n\n<p>Where other big-name diets such as Atkins and Dukan equate to off-the-peg suits, the Nordiska regime sounds like a Savile Row two-piece: a plan tailored specifically to your body&#146;s individual dimensions. It sounds too good to be true &#150; like Dukan with a fancy microscope. I&#146;m going to swallow my scepticism. I&#146;m going to trust to science and stick with the DNA diet for one month to see if I do Iose weight.</p>\n\n<h2>My gene pool</h2>\n<p>At &#163;249, having your genetic code analysed to discover the weight-loss secrets within does not come cheap. Before I sign up, I seek a second opinion on MyGenomics from Daniel MacArthur, a geneticist and founder of the personal genomics website <a href=\"http://www.genomesunzipped.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Genomes Unzipped</a>. He warns me to be wary of the bold statements made by the DNA diet.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;The company states on its website that its product is &#145;proven to have helped 90% of people who have tried it&#146;,&#148; he says. &#147;But that study was based on weight, height and age, not genetic information.&#148; So, the paper cited has nothing to do with DNA. MyGenomics confirms this, but its founder Dr Carolyn Horrocks adds, &#147;The genetics is backed up by data published over the last 10 years in scientific journals,&#148; Suddenly, &#163;249 sounds like a lot to have your genes shot through a spectrometer at a lab in Newcastle.</p>\n\n<p>It also sounds complicated, but my part in it couldn&#146;t be simpler. I decide to register on the website and a DNA swab is sent to me. It plops onto the doormat one morning and looks like a cross between an inter-dental toothbrush and a cotton bud. You simply rub it inside one of your cheeks, put it into a sterile tube and post it back to the lab. While the white coats pick apart my metabolism, appetite control, muscle activity and five other genetic markers, I get as exacting a medical screening as I can: the meticulous WellMan Screening at <a href=\"http://www.champneys.com/Medical\" target=\"_blank\">Champneys Medical Centre</a> in Hertfordshire.You don&#146;t have to do this, it isn&#146;t part of the Nordiska service and, frankly, my findings are not happy ones. They confirm that I am clinically overweight. My waist is a shameful 39in. This fact, in particular, comes as a nasty surprise. Slipping into 36-waist jeans has always been my reason not to panic about my weight.</p>\n\n<p>Further cause for alarm is that my &#145;metabolic age&#146; has edged ahead of my chronological one &#150; meaning that at rest my body burns energy slower than it should for somebody 33 years old. Lean muscle is more metabolically active than body fat, so a higher metabolic age shows I&#146;m fatter and less fit than I thought.</p>\n\n<p>Worst of all is my cholesterol. It&#146;s not through the roof, but it has certainly checked into the penthouse suite. So, despite the warnings about the legitimacy of the Nordiska diet&#146;s promises, I can&#146;t help hoping the white coats are getting more favourable results.</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/yellow-jt-diet-2604.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<h2>The facts of life</h2>\n<p>A week later, my DNA dossier lands on the same doormat as the swab it was extracted from. The conclusion of all 25 pages is that, on a cellular level, I am a very boring man.</p>\n\n<p>The Nordiska system places you into one of 36 potential diet and exercise combinations, based on the variations in the eight genes it isolates in its testing. But in terms of everything from metabolism to muscle function, I am simply &#145;balanced&#146;. I am exactly average. I am, understandably, a little disappointed about this seemingly &#145;off-the-peg&#146; result. A bit of further research online suggests that the DNA diet is not as bespoke as you might think. In fact, there are only four nutritional types you can be matched to: &#145;GI smart&#146;, with an eating plan which ensures you don&#146;t spike your blood-sugar too much; &#145;carb smart&#146;, which limits your carbohydrate intake to 40% of your food; &#145;fat smart&#146;, which is to say, &#145;low fat&#146;; and &#145;balanced&#146; &#150; me &#150; which uses a predictable combination of all of the above. Surely this is all just standard nutritional advice. To this, Dr Carolyn Horrocks explains: &#147;The DNA is used to help choose from the four diets, all of which are commonly used by dietitians. It is the fact that they are matched which helps them to be more efficient.&#148;</p>\n\n<p>On the exercise front, my two fitness-related genes show a &#147;moderate proportion of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibres&#148; and &#147;equal tolerance to strength and endurance&#148;. It sounds like a reassuring slice of sports science, but I am assured by the supplied bumph that I will be prescribed a standard blend of cardio, weights and high-intensity training. In other words, my normal gym routine. Which is already boring.\nI don&#146;t lose faith just yet, though. According to Mariette, my personal dietitian provided as part of the service, falling into the &#145;healthy-balanced&#146; category means I am going to be able to shift weight both quickly and efficiently. Thomas, my assigned exercise consultant, agrees: I will lose weight.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance my DNA diet plan is pretty basic. Far from revolutionary, unheard-of snacks to fight fat and build muscle, Mariette prescribes meals of carefully balanced protein, dairy and carbohydrates. Chicken and couscous salad with feta cheese and spinach isn&#146;t genetics, it&#146;s just dinner. It doesn&#146;t even feel tailor-made for me. My &#145;bespoke&#146; breakfast on the first day of the programme consists of a small bowl of porridge, a piece of wholemeal toast and two poached eggs. Perturbed, I Google Nordiska and find my very own Mariette quoted by the Associated Press: &#147;[The diet] should be practical, it should be realistic, and what we find is that we are more coaches in terms of what they should be doing, rather than telling them exactly, you know, you should be eating 50g carbohydrates a day, for example.&#148;</p>\n\n<h2>Raw deal</h2>\n<p>That was, however, almost exactly what I thought I had signed up for. I wanted a diet so specific to my own body that I would very much be told to eat 50g of carbohydrates a day, if my genes deigned it necessary. It feels a lot like the small changes I am making to my food intake are more common sense than unique science.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I stick to my plan. By the end of the week, my DNA is already dictating all that passes my lips. I sprinkle sunflower seeds on everything and buy bags of nuts in Pret where once I would have had a sandwich. I am eating more carrot sticks and hummus than I thought possible and have discovered the joys of seaweed.</p>\n\n<p>My &#145;boring&#146; genetics do allow me some nutritional excitement, though: a small glass of red wine with dinner every day, and a piece of chocolate for dessert. While <a href=\"http://montezumas.co.uk/chocolate-gifts/dark-chilli-bar.html\" target=\"_blank\">chilli-infused chocolate</a> is delicious, algae is far less palatable. To begin with it tastes (and smells) like a mouthful of The Solent at low tide. But it represents the most surprising diet tip the DNA system gives me, so I stick with that, too. I want to know if my natural confidence in those men in white coats could be why I&#146;m persisting.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;The apparent scientific core of this concept is particularly male-friendly,&#148; says Dr Kerri McPherson, a health psychologist at Glasgow Caledonian University, specialising in body image and eating behaviour. &#147;The element of empiricism allows the whole dieting process to be more acceptable within the context of masculinity.&#148; In other words, as a man, I am more likely to accept Nordiska&#146;s claims and follow their advice because I believe it is based on my own biology &#150; and the fact that it involves fitness, not just calorie counting, adds credibility.</p>\n\n<p>And it&#146;s true. The 25-page DNA dossier is giving me motivation to stay on the genetic wagon, despite the far from earth-shattering impact that it&#146;s had on my diet. The personal attention I receive from my nutritional and exercise consultants is also having a noticeably positive influence on my determination. More than that, it&#146;s working. Despite the weight of my doubts, by the end of the second week, I have lost 2kg.</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/pink-jt-diet-2604.jpg\" /><br /><br />\n\n<p>I still credit this progress to a generally improved diet rather than my training schedule, though. The gym-work is hardly ground-breaking to anyone who has opened this magazine before, let alone someone who works here. Thomas does have something up his sleeve, though. Or, rather, something to go up mine.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;The key to weight loss is to target and control your Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) hours over each week,&#148; he says. &#147;MET is a measure of how much energy you burn during physical activity &#150; the more vigorous the action, the higher the METvalue.&#148; For my body-type, Thomas tells me, I need to aim for 24 MET hours a week for safe weight loss.</p>\n\n<p>I wear a <a href=\"http://www.kiperformance.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Ki-Fit monitor</a> on my upper arm. It measures the regularity and intensity of my movement, much like the new <a href=\"http://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/?l=shop,fuelband\" target=\"_blank\">Nike+ FuelBand</a>, so, regardless of whether I&#146;m working out or walking to work, my MET hours are totted up. Thomas promises me it&#146;s going to work.</p>\n\n<p>It does. While the diet and training regime that&#146;s been prescribed to suit my DNA isn&#146;t going to get me into cover-model shape, I certainly feel fitter. On the Saturday of week three, I run a half-marathon and beat my PB by more than four minutes. While I&#146;m increasingly sure that the DNA diet is having as much of a psychologically positive effect as the actual science of my genetic code, looking at my new personal best, I can&#146;t help but think Nordiska&#146;s service suits me.</p>\n\n<p>After 31 days of DNA dieting, I have a second health screening at Champneys. According to a Stanford University study quoted by the MyGenomics website, you&#146;ll lose more than twice as much weight if you match your diet to your genotype, instead of taking a less targeted approach. After sitting down with Nick Lincoln, senior fitness instructor at <a href=\"http://www.champneys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Champney&#146;s</a>, I would say that, regardless of how the Nordiska diet works, for me, at least, it definitely has.</p>\n\n<p>&#147;On paper, you look like a completely different person,&#148; says Lincoln. &#147;You&#146;ve lost 6kg &#150; that&#146;s very nearly a stone. Your metabolism has speeded up significantly, your waist has shrunk by 4in. These are absolutely stunning results.&#148;</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/jon-thompson-diet-2604.jpg\" /><br /><br />\n<h2>The verdict</h2>\n<p>I am indeed stunned. The tests show I&#146;ve lost 7% of my total bodyweight, my blood pressure is down and my cholesterol has plummeted. I have reduced my metabolic age by a decade. The diet and exercise plans I was prescribed were far from futuristic. &#145;Balanced&#146; or no, the Nordiska system seems like a combination of solid advice in scientific goggles. I am a man with faith in science, and that&#146;s why it worked.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel MacArthur remains unsure. &#147;We still know very little about the genetic basis of variation in diet responses, and consumers should be extremely wary about the claims made by companies operating in this area,&#148; he says. &#147;It&#146;s very likely that you would lose just as much weight by following a standard diet and exercise regime without the expense of DNA testing.&#148;</p>\n\n<p>The DNA diet did work for me. You can see that in the pictures and the numbers. Even despite my misgivings about how legitimate the system really is, just knowing that an extra level of tailoring went into my plan gave me what I needed to lose weight. The scientists had given me more than faith &#150; they gave me motivation. As to whether you should pay &#163;249 for that, you have to go with your gut.</p>\n\n<br /><img src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/champneys-sell-1405.jpg\" /><br

The superstition started with fishermen who\nbelieved that the presence of a banana would bring bad luck for that day's\ncatch. Others take the myth more seriously, thinking that a banana on a boat\nwill bring death. According to the <em><a title=\"Going Bananas\" href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/17/sports/sp-35188\" target=\"_blank\">Los\nAngeles Times</a></em>, modern day sailors and boaters are still extremely superstitious\nwhen it comes to bananas. Many captains go a step further than banning the\nyellow fruit, and also prohibit Banana Republic and Fruit of the Loom clothing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Mark Your Calendar: 17 Weird Food Holidays\" href=\"http://www.delish.com/food-fun/weird-food-holidays#slide-1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>More From Delish: Mark Your Calendar: 17 Weird Food Holidays</strong></a></p>\n<p>2. <strong>Salt</strong>: Spilling salt is possibly the most popularized food\nsuperstition. Luckily, this one has an easy remedy. While spilling salt is\nthought to be unlucky, throwing a pinch over your left shoulder is said to\ncounteract the bad luck. <a title=\"Very superstitious: Severing friendships and wishing upon cakes\" href=\"http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/09/29/very-superstitious-severing-friendships-and-wishing-upon-cakes/\" target=\"_blank\">Eatocracy</a> reports that the toss over the left shoulder\nis based on historical mythology that the Devil sits on your left shoulder and\nan angel sits on your right. Thus, tossing salt over the left wards off evil.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>13 People at a Dinner Party</strong>: Having 13 guests at a dinner\nparty is also thought to be unlucky. The superstition has been a part of French\nculture throughout history. According to the <em><a title=\"Friday The 13th Superstitions: Where'd They Come From?\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/13/friday-the-13th-superstitions_n_861416.html#s51643&title=Dinner_luck\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a></em>, there are French\nsocialites called <i>quatorziens</i> (fourteeners), who are available to fill in as a\n14th dinner guest to rescue the other 13 attendees from bad luck.\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt also believed in this superstition, and refused to\nhave 13 guests at dinner parties.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.delish.com/entertaining-ideas/parties/wedding/global-wedding-traditions#slide-1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>More From Delish: \"I Do\" Foods: Global Culinary Wedding\nTraditions</strong></a></p>\n<p>4. <strong>Cutting Noodles</strong>: While noodles are thought to bring\ngood fortune and a long life in Chinese culture, cutting those same noodles\nbrings about a different fortune. According to <a title=\"Good Luck Food\" href=\"http://wishgoodluck.com/symbols/good-luck-food/\" target=\"_blank\">WishGoodLuck.com</a>, cutting\nnoodles (especially those served on the New Year&#160;and at birthday parties) causes\nbad luck and a shortened lifespan.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Hot Peppers and Friendship</strong>: While there are several\nversions of this myth, many believe that pepper (the spice) or hot peppers can\nbring discontent among friends. One version of the superstition says that\nspilling pepper can cause disagreements between friends. According to <a title=\"Freaky Food Superstitions\" href=\"http://www.myrecipes.com/holidays-and-occasions/food-superstitions-10000001811429/page10.html\" target=\"_blank\">MyRecipes</a>,\nwhen working in the kitchen, handing a hot chili pepper directly to a friend\nwill cause disagreements in your relationship. However, the bad luck can be\navoided by putting the hot pepper down on a surface and allowing said friend to\npick it up as a separate action.</p>\n<p>Do you believe in food superstitions?

It's a standard established by Olivier's father, Alexandre Reza, as he was building his reputation as a gem merchant with a singular eye and an unmatched stock of stones. In the 1950s and '60s Alexandre Reza was the man Harry Winston, Cartier, and Boucheron turned to when a client requested a particularly rare piece. \"When Alexandre Reza was coming to an auction,\" writes Sotheby's chairman David Bennett in the preface to <i>Alexandre Reza</i>, a 188-page, $1,000 oversize tome published in May by Assouline, \"you must have something rather special on show.\" </p>\n\n<p>By the late 1960s Alexandre was using his impressive inventory to design his own jewelry, and he built quite a following. His shop next to the Ritz was visited by clients like Sammy Davis Jr., who frequently wore a ruby-encrusted Reza brooch on a gold pendant. The American socialite Florence Gould bought, among other things, a 49-carat diamond necklace. (The piece sold for $990,000 at auction in 1984.) \"Alexandre was a real artist,\" says Bernard Ruiz Picasso, grandson of Pablo. \"Besides having very important stones, he had the patience to wait to find the one that would make the necklace. He was a true creator of jewelry, and there are few of those left.\" </p>\n\n<p>Alexandre was born in Moscow into a Jewish family that fled to Paris in the early part of the 20th century. The Assouline book, besides displaying glossy pictures of jewelry, deftly chronicles a life story that one might expect more from a novel than a coffee-table book. Alexandre was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943, and he eluded death by waving his old Persian passport and reciting passages he'd memorized from the Koran. When that wore thin he told the officers who had looted his Nice boutique that the inventory list was incomplete--they needed to keep him alive until they got it all. He was liberated in 1944 and made his way back to Paris. </p><p>Alexandre Reza on the Place Vend&#244;me was shuttered in 2008, when Alexandre was stricken with Alzheimer's. The stones remained in their vaults, and thousands of unrealized sketches were scattered in desk drawers and boxes. It took Olivier, a partner at Lazard in New York, three years to decide to reopen the salon. Now visitors to 21 Place Vend&#244;me walk through electronic doors and are greeted by a subtle painting of a necklace. \"My father did one like this for Florence Gould,\" says Olivier, \"and another in emeralds for the sultan of Brunei.\" It's a lot to live up to, but Olivier, besides having the benefit of his father's inventory and his own acquired eye for stones, has a clear focus. \"I'm here to create collectible pieces and to educate collectors,\" says Olivier, in jeans and Nikes with neon green laces, sitting near the Jacobean club chairs his father bought from Hubert de Givenchy's estate and a malachite-trimmed vitrine his father kept in the store. \"But there is also something patrimonial about jewelry. I love those Patek Philippe ads. These too are things to be passed on.\" </p>\n\n\n<p><em>Above:</em> Olivier Reza and his mother Karin, photographed at 21 Place Vend&#244;me, their newly reopened jewelry salon, founded by Alexandre Reza.

The trend toward super-lightweight, razor-thin ultrabooks has forced computer makers to jettison extravagances such as optical drives, large-capacity hard drives, extra ports, big screens, and multi-memory-card readers. Most of that stuff just weighed us down when we took our laptops on the road. But the thing is, when you sit at your desk, you sort of want it all back. Optical discs may be a thing of the past, but we've got plenty of such things of the past sitting in our offices. Cloud storage for your files is nice, but a 2-terabyte drive on your desktop is even nicer. And a laptop with two USB ports is about four short of acceptable. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nSo we decided to make the best of both worlds. We took a Dell XPS 13, one of the sleekest, sexiest ultrabooks on the market, and designed a docking station that incorporated everything the computer was  lacking and then some. The idea was to take a sturdy, generic desk from Crate and Barrel, then screw and strap a bunch of accessories onto it&#151;a  perfect marriage of home electronics and Home Depot. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe insisted on a few eccentricities that, frankly, made the project a lot harder. For instance, our 24-inch Sony PlayStation 3D display didn't have standard VESA mounting points to mate to our swing-arm Ergotron desk mount, so we drilled a few holes into a steel plate and fashioned our own adapter bracket. That allowed us to hide a PS3 under the desk and use the monitor for computing and 3D gaming. Why, you ask? Well, why not? If the Dell ultrabook demonstrates the elegance of understatement, the desk underneath it is our tribute to the awesomeness of overkill.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>How Much Gear Can We Fit Onto A Single Desk?</strong></h3><br />\n\n<strong>1.</strong> We took a slim, lightweight <strong>Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook ($1000)</strong> and modified a desk with extra components to fatten up its functionality. Here's what we added.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>2. Macally EcofanPro ($40)</strong> This beautiful bamboo laptop stand has an integrated cooling fan.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>3. Playstation 3 320 GB ($300)</strong> All work and no play...\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>4. Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 6000($90)</strong> A two-part keyboard saves space&#151;stow the number pad when you don't need it.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>5. Sony PlayStation 3D Display ($500)</strong> The monitor for our laptop and PlayStation shows games in 3D or gives two players separate views.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>6. Wacom Intuos5 (Large) ($470)</strong> Both a touchpad and a pen-input tablet, with 102 square inches of work area.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>7. Altec Lansing BXR1220 2.0 Speaker System ($20)</strong>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>8. Optical drive ($32) and card reader ($22)</strong> We went the bargain-basement generic route on these components, then hid them beneath the desktop.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>9. Tursion Unimax Charging Dock ($39)</strong> This charger has four interchangeable ports for smartphones, iPods, etc.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>10. Twelve South HoverBar ($80)</strong> This gooseneck mount clamps to a desk and suspends your iPad in midair.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Mod Your Desk</strong></h3><br />\n\nThat \"finished\" piece of furniture you bought is a few holes, wires, ports, and outlets short of its cyborg ideal. Charge up your power tools.\n<br /><br />\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/oy/laptop-desk-02-0612-de.jpg\"></div>\n<strong>1. Start With The Boring Stuff</strong> \n<br /><br />\nPosition your equipment where you want it on the desk. Group the gear around one or two spots where you can route all of your wiring, then mark those spots for drilling. Clear off the gadgets and tape the desk surface to prevent damage. A 1-inch holesaw will make an opening for five or six wires.\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Ns/laptop-desk-03-0612-de.jpg\"></div>\n<strong>2. Free Your Monitor</strong> \n<br /><br />\nThis PlayStation 3D monitor was not made to be mounted, but we did it anyway, using a few semi-trustworthy anchor points and an Ergotron LX desk mount ($170). A monitor on a swing arm is worth the trouble&#151;it frees up desk space and lets you place your screen virtually anywhere.\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/mG/laptop-desk-04-0612-de.jpg\"></div>\n<strong>3. Embrace The Underbelly</strong> \n<br /><br />\nIf you're trying to accommodate lots of stuff, try this tactic: We flipped our desk over and attached components (PS3, optical drive, extra USB ports) to the underside using plastic plumber's tape. When possible, we also used the desk's existing fasteners.\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n<div style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/cw/laptop-desk-05-0612-de.jpg\"></div>\n<strong>4. Don't Skimp on Outlets</strong> \n<br /><br />\nWe needed a power strip, but we didn't want to see it. And don't you just hate it when surge protectors get crowded by large adapters? This 4-foot-long Tripp Lite strip ($48) fixed both problems with 16 amply spaced outlets and mounting brackets that let you hide it under the desk.\n<br /><br /><br /><br />","article_type_name":"Open

In the video Bryan</strong></span> Dussault posted on YouTube in February 2010, the <i>Sesame Street</i> favorite is strapped into a child-safety seat. Dussault tightens the five-point harness and then abruptly yanks the unit's shoulder straps, which are supposed to be snug against the infant passenger. The harness straps loosen. Dussault pulls the shaggy toy away as if it were being tossed, unprotected, in a high-speed collision. To anyone viewing the clip, but perhaps especially to anyone who travels in a car with a child, the scenario is startling and scary.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe series of events that led Dussault to film the sequence began on a freezing Chicago day earlier that winter. At the time his son was 3 years old. It was Grandma's turn to pick up the boy at preschool. But there was a problem. \"My mother-in-law called me,\" Dussault says, \"and said she couldn't get the car-seat straps to tighten up.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nDussault drove to the school and took his child home himself, along with the car seat that had apparently failed. He owned the same item&#151;the $79 Vantage, purchased at Walmart and sold under the Safety 1st brand name. In his garage Dussault tested his own seat; again, the straps loosened. \"I knew that if I got two doing that,\" he says, \"there were probably thousands out there doing the same thing.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nDussault contacted the seats' manufacturer, Dorel Juvenile Group. Based in Columbus, Ind., Dorel is the world's largest maker of children's car seats. It sells about 8 million child-restraint systems&#151;the official term for car seats&#151;each year. But shoppers won't find the Dorel name in stores. Instead, the company's goods appear under a range of recognizable brands including Disney, Cosco, Eddie Bauer, and Maxi-Cosi. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDorel offered to exchange Dussault's seats. But when the replacements arrived, Dussault says they failed his test as well. He filed a complaint with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Meanwhile, Dorel asked him to return the original seats so the company could test them, standard procedure when an exchange is offered. Dussault was hesitant. \"They were hot on my tail to get these seats out of my hands,\" he says. The company, he believed, intended to \"sweep things under the rug.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nTo prevent that from happening, Dussault made the video. He contacted the news media. A local NBC affiliate dispatched a crew. The demise of Elmo went viral, and in 2011 Dorel recalled 800,000 car seats. A win for Elmo and kids everywhere? \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThat's debatable.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Dussault describes his struggle in David and Goliath terms</strong></span>, a concerned parent confronting a faceless corporation whose interests are driven more by sales than by safety. When it comes to products designed to protect children, that position isn't difficult to understand. I'm the father of a 16-month-old, and even before our son arrived, my wife and I did what most expectant families do: We went shopping. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nI was amazed by the number of products available and dismayed by how many appeared to be defective&#151;car seats, strollers, toys, cribs, nursery monitors. It seemed impossible to pick a category that wasn't prone to recalls. When my wife and I debated whether to allow our infant to sleep in the same bed with us, we were told that the only safe way to do so was to buy a \"positioning device,\" a product that would prevent a sleepy parent from rolling over and smushing the poor tyke (never mind that parents have been cuddling their children to sleep for millennia). We rejected the advice, and good thing: On our next visit to Babies \"R\" Us, the positioner aisle was empty. It turned out the device itself could lead to suffocation if a child were pressed against it the wrong way. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAt first my impression was similar to Dussault's: a rogue industry. A little research seemed to back that up. NHTSA recalled more than 100 different models of car seats from nearly a dozen manufacturers during the past decade. And media accounts almost always emphasize the profit-trumps-all angle when it comes to product defects. Particularly notable is a 2007 <i>Chicago Tribune</i> story that chronicled Dorel's attempts to prevent an earlier recall. Dorel had argued&#151;correctly but unsuccessfully&#151;that the straps on the car seats weren't up to standards because there were no clear standards when they were manufactured in 2000 and 2001. Other companies, it pointed out, used materials of similar strength and design and hadn't been penalized. The reporters painted the company as uncaring, even conspiratorial&#151;quoting an internal email from a Dorel executive who wrote: \"Why? It still sells.\" The series of investigative reports that included the story won a Pulitzer Prize. And after losing an appeal to the NHTSA in 2010, Dorel was forced to recall about 4 million car seats. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut eventually I began to question whether product defects could really be so rampant. Most of the recalls I had read about appeared to be for items that caused no injuries or where injuries could only be vaguely attributed to a specific problem. As I began to search my home for recalled products&#151;not just stuff aimed at kids, but appliances, tools, electronics, and everything else modern shoppers own and covet&#151;I quickly became overwhelmed. There were so many recalls and so many sources of information on recalled products that I could barely keep track. Did I own dangerous items? Were they really dangerous or just potentially dangerous? And what action should I take, if any?\n\n<br /><br />\n\nTrying to sort through it all was impossible, so I gave up. And in that way I became an even more typical American consumer: one unable to make my home truly safer, because the system by which we judge, identify, and correct broken gear is as defective as anything found on store shelves. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>In the United States, product recalls are overseen by six federal agencies</strong></span>. The majority come under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which handles everything from toys and power tools to appliances. Recalls connected to automobiles&#151;cars, tires, and child-restraint systems&#151;are within the NHTSA's purview. Boats and nautical items are regulated by the Coast Guard. Products containing chemicals, such as house paint and pesticides, are Environmental Protection Agency territory; the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) handle edibles, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe division of federal oversight&#151;car seats to the NHTSA, strollers to the CPSC; burgers to the USDA, fries to the FDA&#151;is just the beginning of the knot consumers need to untangle if they're hoping to learn whether a product they own poses a threat. Though there's ostensibly a one-stop database of product alerts, <a href=\"http://www.recalls.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">recalls.gov</a>, the website's utility is marred by confusing design and poor information retrieval. Clicking on the Search for Recalls button opens a page with six additional search boxes, each tied to a different agency or category. If you don't know what jurisdiction a product falls under, you'll have little success, which may be just as well: Sometimes products are identified only by inventory-control codes useful to retailers and manufacturers. Photographs are often unavailable. If you do manage to discover a potentially relevant recall, you're given the investigation number assigned by the overseeing agency but not always a link to the investigative details themselves. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nDetails that are included don't generally provide context for injuries or useful consumer information. For example, the notice for a Task Force electric log splitter, recalled in July 2011, states that two injuries had been reported after operators placed their hands on the handle while the splitter was in operation. The notice instructs consumers to stop using the product and send for free warning labels. \"That has got to be one of the weirdest recalls we've ever seen,\" wrote Everett Snyder on <a href=\"http://www.protoolreviews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ProToolReviews.com</a>. \"The recall itself doesn't do too much to explain the problem or deliver specific (detailed) instructions for safe use of the tool... No, for that you need to wait for the stickers to show up.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThis muddle is made worse by the scale and number of recalls. During the past five years, more than 150 million children's items, 110 million household goods, and 9 million pieces of sporting equipment have been recalled by the CPSC alone, according to the recall-tracking group WeMakeItSafer. There are so many recalls&#151;nearly 1500 by all six agencies in 2011&#151;that many consumers have simply stopped paying attention to them. A 2010 <i>Consumer Reports</i> survey found that just under 25 percent of respondents ever bothered to research whether a product they owned had been subject to a recall; of those who knew they owned a recalled product, only about 30 percent actually did something about it. There's even a new term for the phenomenon of ignoring product-safety warnings: recall fatigue. \"So many recalls are announced in so many ways that when you hear it on the news, it just doesn't register,\" says Craig Wilson, vice president of quality assurance at Costco Wholesale Corp. \"The perception is that there's a lot of crying wolf going on.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>A day after Elmo's mishap hit Chicago airwaves</strong></span>, the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation opened case PE10-009&#151;a preliminary evaluation, which doesn't indicate that a recall is necessary or even being contemplated. Though the agency receives about 35,000 consumer complaints each year, just two&#151;both Dussault's&#151;had been registered for the Vantage, which had been highly rated in <i>Consumer Reports</i>. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nPreliminary or not, opening an investigation also opens floodgates. The manufacturer of the product in question is required to deliver thousands of pages of data: test results, transcripts of customer-service calls, descriptions of manufacturing procedures, sales figures. The NHTSA announces the inquiry to the public, an evidence-seeking strategy that can lead to hundreds of additional complaints. For the Vantage, it yielded only six new reports, none of which involved injuries. Despite this, the agency moved the inquiry to the next level: engineering analysis. On July 2,2010, case EA10-005 was opened: Dorel was asked to provide complete details on how the seat was built and tested, and whether any changes had been made at the factory that might have coincided with the complaints of strap slippage. Over the next couple of months, Dorel submitted thousands more pages of documentation.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn an 11-page letter to the NHTSA dated Sept. 21, Terry Emerson, Dorel's director of quality assurance, stated that no slippage had occurred in the Vantage's initial rounds of testing&#151;2900 on crash sleds and 2000 mechanical strap pulls. The public investigation attracted 40 additional complaints, representing 0.00005 percent of seats sold. No injuries or deaths were reported. Dorel, Emerson wrote, \"does not believe the subject units contain a safety-related defect.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut the company did find that some center front adjusters (CFAs)&#151;the locking and release buttons that secure the straps&#151;could, if excessively dirty, not tighten as well as a new product's (though that could be remedied by making sure the CFA is actually pressed firmly into place). And so, on Feb. 14, 2011, Dorel initiated a voluntary recall, offering what consumer-safety specialists call a sealed fix&#151;a repair kit rather than a full product swap. The kit consisted of a tiny tube of food-grade lubricant; the primary ingredient, canola oil. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe main difference between Dorel's remedy and a squirt of something from a typical pantry is a sticker that comes with the kit, indicating the fix has been applied. But there is no evidence that the tube-of-lube solution addresses what caused Dussault's seats to fail. When Dorel finally got those car seats back, it couldn't reproduce the problem. Nor could outside testers, including <i>Consumer Reports,</i> which takes an aggressive stance toward product safety. Though Dorel won't disclose how much the recall cost, its annual reports indicate the juvenile division has spent more than $50 million in the past five years on product liability expenses.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nBarry Mahal, Dorel's executive vice president for child-restraint systems, says the company agreed to the recall out of \"an abundance of caution.\" What Mahal didn't add was that Dorel also likely agreed to the recall because it knew it couldn't win; it had already been down that road with the recall that led to the Pulitzer Prize&#151;winning investigation. Though the <i>Tribune</i> reporters quoted a Dorel attorney pointing out that a particular car crash, not a product defect, may have caused a child's injuries, the story ended with a depiction of that child rocking back and forth in her kindergarten class, unable to speak or seemingly comprehend.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/why-product-recalls-make-you-less-safe-8347658-2\">Tragedy and Recall >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Jo/product-recall-02-0612-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-21T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Koeppel","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8347658","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-06-20T20:38:25.000Z","author_id":"5888","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/why-product-recalls-make-you-less-safe-8347658","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Join us at Space nightclub in Ibiza for the biggest party of the Summer...","site_id":"579","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.company.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"2011, 14th, style, november, blog:, 18th, editor, -","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Party with COMPANY in Ibiza!","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-06-20T10:38:33.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Theresa","source_id":"641","teaser":"Join us at Space nightclub in Ibiza for the biggest party of the Summer...","origin_site_id":"579","sub_heading":"Join us at Space nightclub in Ibiza for the biggest party of the Summer...","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"Join us at Space nightclub in Ibiza for the biggest party of the Summer...","url_name":"company-magazine-ibiza-party-2012","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-04-16T11:58:00.000Z","title":"Party with COMPANY in Ibiza!","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Party with COMPANY in Ibiza!","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"505","active":"Y","site_id":"579","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-jwood","last_name":"Caney","email":"Theresa.Caney@natmags.co.uk","creation_date":"2010-12-16T15:10:51.000Z","id":"11081","last_updated_date":"2010-12-16T15:10:51.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Theresa"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Get ready party people - Company is hosting a massive summer party on Sunday 24 June, in association with <a href=\"http://www.welove-music.com\" target=\"_blank\">We Love...</a> at Ibiza&#146;s best known club, Space, and sponsored by the amazing hair care and salon brand, <a href=\"http://www.markhill.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Hill</a> - so we can party AND have amazing looking hair!</p>\n<p>All of this means that you get to party the night away at the best club on the island AND meet the Company team!</p>\n<p>Special VIP Company Access for 20 euros (normal club tickets priced 45 euros), with re-entry wristbands available to early arrivals (pre 8.30pm) &#150; which is a bonus as this ties in with makeovers and fashion shows on offer!*</p>\n<p>You&#146;ll also get a goody bag worth &#163;100 - so, if you're heading to Ibiza this summer, don't miss the biggest, coolest, hippest party everyone&#146;s talking about.

The tips that follow will help you save time <em>and</em> money, both when deal-searching and while actually on vacation.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Airfare secret weapon </strong></p>\n<p>You've probably never heard about the ITA Matrix website (<a href=\"http://www.itasoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">matrix.itasoftware.com</a>), because it is not a ticket-booking site. But it has one terrific time-saving feature, an ultra-clear calendar that shows the lowest fare each day for one month from your specified departure date. (Click the See Calendar of Lowest Fares button when entering your itinerary; you will see flights listed by the individual airlines, not meta-sites like <a href=\"http://www.kayak.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayak.com</a>.) At press time, for instance, we typed in a Chicago &#151; Seattle itinerary, departing July 14, 2012. Instantly, we saw that the lowest fare on 28 of the next 30 days was $383. The only better fare, $381, was to be had on August 14. That's good to know: It's not worth spending a lot of time online trying various departure and return dates to save two bucks.</p>\n<p>Once you've settled on a departure date, click that date box on the calendar. That brings up a screen with all the flights, ordered by price, for your itinerary. Now comes the only clunky part: You have to call the airline or go to its website to book that flight, since ITA Matrix won't do it for you &#151; or you can click Email This Itinerary so your travel agent can book the ticket. But the at-a-glance ease of the site makes it a terrific time- and money-saver.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Go for Web package deals</strong></p>\n<p>For the biggest bang from your vacation buck, \"don't buy &#224; la carte,\" says George Hobica, founder of <a href=\"http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">airfarewatchdog.com</a>, an airfare-comparison website. According to Hobica, the biggest Web travel agencies, which have the most pricing power, put together wallet-friendly airfare-plus-hotel packages; he recommends <a href=\"expedia.com%20\" target=\"_blank\">expedia.com </a>above others. \"Expedia has all major U.S. airlines except Southwest and Allegiant,\" says Hobica, \"and like other online travel agencies, it is excellent at combining airlines to get the cheapest fare.\"</p>\n<p>Our Web searches supported this recommendation. First, we pitted an <a href=\"http://www.expedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">expedia.com</a> package (flight, hotel, rental car) against an &#224; la carte booking of the components for a one-week Chicago &#151; Seattle vacation departing on July 14, 2012. The cheapest package on <a href=\"http://www.expedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">expedia.com</a> cost $1,772 for two, with accommodation at the Mediterranean Inn, a two-and-a-half-star hotel. Booking the components separately cost $1,978, or $206 more.</p>\n<p>Then we put <a href=\"http://www.expedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">expedia.com</a> up against <a href=\"http://www.orbitz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">orbitz.com</a> on package rates for the same itinerary. True, Orbitz came up with a $1,572 package, but the hotel was at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, 11 miles south of the city, which seemed penny-wise, pound-foolish. Orbitz's best in-city package (at a three-star hotel) came to $1,920.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get breakfast for free</strong></p>\n<p>Cutting out one meal tab saves a bundle (or lets you splurge on dinner). Hotels that offer complimentary breakfasts (though not all will be a hot meal) are listed by a number of websites, among them <a href=\"http://www.quikbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">quikbook.com</a> (28 North American cities) and <a href=\"http://www.hotels.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hotels.com</a> (one-third of the hotels it lists). Embassy Suites offers free breakfast at every one of its hotels &#151; and it's not just cold cereal; omelets are on the menu. How much can a bonus like this save you? At Starbucks, coffee and a breakfast pastry or sandwich can cost $4, so a family of four keeps about $16 more a day by eating in.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Know when it pays to cash in miles</strong></p>\n<p>If you're wondering whether to blow your precious stockpile of frequent-flyer miles this summer, follow a simple formula developed by Matthew Bennett, editor of First Class Flyer (<a href=\"http://www.firstclassflyer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">firstclassflyer.com</a>). Use 2 cents as the value of each loyalty-program mile when traveling coach; most U.S. carriers sell miles at 2.5 cents or more. Simply divide the fare you would have to pay (search online) by 25,000 (the number of miles most U.S. carriers charge for a free domestic economy-class ticket) or by the number of miles your carrier charges. If the quotient is more than 2 cents, use your miles--you're getting good value for them. If the quotient is less, purchase the ticket and earn more miles. So a $500 ticket yields a return of 2 cents, a decent use of your miles, whereas a $250 fare yields a pitiable 1-cent return.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Get the best hotel-room rates </strong></p>\n<p>Hotel rates aren't as volatile as airline fares, but they do change frequently. Now there's a website that helps you nab the lowest rate possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tingo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tingo.com</a>, just launched in March, is part of a mega travel-website conglomerate, and its hotel inventory is powered by the Expedia Affiliate Network. The site keeps an inventory of hotel rooms; more than 95% of them, according to the company, are flagged as \"Money Back,\" meaning you can take advantage of price drops after you book your room. Some specifics: Book a \"Money Back\" room on the site, and Tingo will scan for discounts and automatically rebook your reservation whenever one is available, sending you an e-mail with the new rate and reservation number. This process continues until a day or two before you check in (depending on the hotel's cancellation policy), ensuring a rock-bottom rate.</p>\n<p>When we checked out the site, we scanned for hotels in Orlando, FL, and found that the \"Money Back\" offers for a weeklong stay included a wide range of accommodations. We found everything from a two-star Days Inn for $31 a night to a four-and-a-half-star Loews at $220 a night &#151; before the discounts kicked in.</p>\n<p>So how much can you save? Research indicates that one-third of hotel bookings go down in price between the time the reservation is made and the time the guest checks in, with the average price drop amounting to $36 on a two-night stay. But you could save much more. Among the specific examples Tingo cited was a booking in New Hampshire that was originally priced at $616.92, but that had already dropped by $293.76 well before check-in. Other examples are more modest: A Hilton Head Island, SC, reservation for $263.51 dropped by $35.13; a one-night $148.08 stay in Laguna Beach, CA, dipped by $22.96 before check-in. Even if the savings are small, that cash back on your hotel costs can be put toward cool drinks or cute souvenirs when you enjoy your budget-friendly getaway.</p>\n","publish_date":"2012-06-19T04:00:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Article","import_chan_id":null,"partner_related_links_list_article":[],"votes":"0","promo_image_id":"987441","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","allow_email_this":"1","total_rate":"0.00","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/mQ/0612-piggy-banks-on-beach-msc.jpg","version":"1","author_last_name":"Walther","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"article_type_prefix":"article","in_this_issue_text":"","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372729","related_links":"<a

Imagine a motocross circuit at one-tenth scale but meant for mountain bikes or a kid's BMX. When Mark Weir finished the pump track at his home in Marin County, Calif., local kids swarmed&#151;and their dads asked Weir to build tracks in their yards too. Now he is working on a $1 million version for nearby Stafford Lake. \"Once you start, you have to realize the addiction that comes with it&#151;all of a sudden you're more of a builder than a rider,\" he says. To get the advice laid out above for DIY builders, we turned to Lee McCormack, who wrote <i>Welcome to Pump Track Nation</i> and has created hundreds of tracks.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/WB/bike-track-0612-de.jpg\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>MCCORMACK'S TRACK TIPS</strong></h3><br />\n\n<b>DESIGN: </b>Avoid flat spots. \"Every square inch should tilt up, down, or sideways, to keep momentum going.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>SITE: </b>Build on a 3 percent slope to avoid flooding. Got a flat lot? Dig French drains at the berms.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>CONSTRUCTION: </b>Pile dirt 50 percent higher than the final dimension to account for compaction. Then carve out the contours.\"It's almost impossible to get a nice shape by adding dirt. It's easier to move it.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>MAINTENANCE: </b>Run a sprinkler to lightly soak the track before each ride. Let it nearly dry, and then pedal like crazy to \"burn in\" a line.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>RIDING: </b>Ratchet the pedals in short quarter-turns and push down with your arms off the backsides of rollers. Don't pedal continuously.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>WORKOUT: </b>The top priority is fun, but pump tracks also build MMA-worthy core strength and balance skills.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>INPUTS</strong></h3><br />\n\n<b>THE DIRT:</b> Clay loam or topsoil mixed with clay is best. A 40 x 30&#151;foot area takes 27 cubic yards. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>HAND TOOLS:</b> Wheel-barrow, shovels, string and dowels for layout, a soil tamper.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<b>THE MACHINE:</b> Yes, this counts as an excuse to rent an earthmover.\n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Open Format Article","publish_date":"2012-06-15T17:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11119","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Frank","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8347632","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"10","last_updated_date":"2012-06-15T17:19:40.000Z","author_id":"11254","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/how-to-build-a-backyard-bike-track-8347632","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":null,"site_id":"818","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.womansday.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"pulled pork recipes, slowcook pork, slow cooker pork, pulled pork sandwiches, pork recipes, slow cook recipes","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Slow Cooker Pulled-Pork Sandwiches with Cabbage Slaw","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-03T14:10:19.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Woman's Day Kitchen","source_id":"1","teaser":null,"origin_site_id":"818","sub_heading":null,"pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"pulled-pork-sandwiches-with-cabbage-slaw-recipe","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-04-21T23:59:07.000Z","title":"Slow Cooker Pulled-Pork Sandwiches with Cabbage Slaw","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Slow Cooker Pulled-Pork Sandwiches with Cabbage Slaw &#150;

Art \"Papi\" Guzman, gaze fixed</strong></span> forward, strides through the hangar at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. The stoic pilot is focused on the day's mission. His hard, square face probably wouldn't flinch if a tennis ball bounced off his forehead. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nGuzman must haul 8600 pounds of high-octane aviation gasoline 100 miles north, over the peaks of the Chocolate Mountains. The trip will take 20 minutes. A half-hour after landing, the two Marines riding in the back will convert an empty patch of desert into a refueling station for Cobra attack helicopters that are conducting live-fire rocket practice. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThis training mission is ideal for  Guzman's ride. An MV-22 Osprey can carry 20,000 pounds of cargo (or 24 troops) internally. No other Marine heli copter can deliver this much fuel as quickly; the V-22 goes twice as fast as the tandem-rotor CH-46E Sea Knight and it can transport nearly three times the payload. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhat makes the Osprey unique is its ability to tilt its rotors, producing more lift than thrust, which enables the airplane to hover and fly like a helicopter. Two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C-Liberty engines, each delivering 6150 shaft horsepower, are mounted within nacelles at the tip of each wing. Those nacelles can rotate 38-foot-diameter propellers between 0 and 96 degrees in as little as 12 seconds. \"Anytime I'm in helo mode,\" Guzman says, \"I want to go faster.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nTwo Ospreys have been charged with completing today's task; VMM-161, the Greyhawks, are training for an upcoming mission to Afghanistan and the squadron needs flight time. Under a leaden sky that promises more rain, Guzman's co-pilot and ground crews are prepping the Ospreys. Their rotors start to spin, the wash tracing intricate patterns on the rainwater pooled on the tarmac.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>A Legacy of Fixes</strong></h3><br />\n\n<em>The Osprey is not the same aircraft that was tested decades ago. Engineers have solved many of the problems that gave the aircraft its bad reputation.</em> \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>HINKY HYDRAULICS</strong></span>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Titanium hydraulic lines leading to the nacelles used to rub against wire harnesses. This created holes in the lines that caused fires; in 2000 one such fire contributed to a crash that killed four Marines.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> By 2005, the problematic hydraulic lines had been rerouted. They are now easier to access for evaluation and repair.\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>DANGEROUS DESCENTS</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Rotorcraft that descend too quickly at slow speeds can lose lift if the rotor dips too far into its own downwash. This is called vortex ring state&#151;an Osprey in VRS can lose lift on one side and flip; 19 Marines died in one such accident during the aircraft's development.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Ospreys have audio and visual warnings that alert pilots when VRS conditions start to form. Pilots can tilt the rotors forward to escape, if the aircraft has enough altitude to maneuver.\n<br /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>UNDERARMED FOR HOT LZS</strong></span>\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Ospreys fly into landing zones that are defended by enemy fire (hot LZs). Critics once complained about the craft's lack of armaments.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Some Ospreys now have 7.62-mm GAU miniguns mounted in their bellies; they are remotely operated by the crew inside the aircraft.\n\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Anatomy of a Spec Ops V-22 Osprey</strong></h3><br />\n\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/planes-uavs/anatomy-of-a-special-operations-v-22-osprey\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/Dm/ospreyslideshow-495x170-061412.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Anatomy of a Spec Ops V-22 Osprey\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Costs and Benefits</strong></h3><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>No other modern military aircraft evokes the reaction generated by the Osprey</strong></span>. It's an engineering marvel and a target of abuse. Crusading bloggers and politicians denigrate it; pilots and military brass say it is revolutionizing the concept of air mobility. Regardless, the aircraft is here to stay. The Marine Corps and the Air Force Special Operations Command both use Ospreys, and both will receive more for years to come.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWith its ability to shape-shift, the V-22 is a complicated aircraft. Miles of hydraulic and fuel lines run through the wings, and the fuselage must be tough enough to resist deformation despite the movement of the two 971-pound engines. Adding to the challenge, the propellers must fold so the V-22 can operate from ships.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA litany of problems&#151;leaking hydraulics, onboard fires, and in certain conditions, aeronautic instability&#151;plagued the aircraft during its 30-year development. This troubled program took a human toll&#151;30 Marines were killed in three crashes during testing. Engineers have systematically addressed the plane's design flaws (see \"A Legacy of Fixes,\" page 82), but the media piled on to what they saw as an obvious villain; the abuse reached a peak in 2007, when a <i>Time</i> magazine cover story labeled the Osprey \"A Flying Shame.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe stigma still lingers. In the past year the <i>New York Times</i> editorial board has denounced the V-22 as \"accident-prone\" and \"unsafe.\" An April MV-22 crash during a training exercise in Morocco that killed  two Marines will likely feed into this reputation. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nBut since its 2007 deployment the Osprey has proved to be safe while flying in some of the most inhospitable conditions imaginable. There has been only one fatal crash in combat: In 2010 in Afghanistan an Air Force CV-22 touched down short of its landing zone, hit a ditch, and flipped, killing four of the 20 aboard. \"Over 10 years, Ospreys have been the Corps' safest combat rotorcraft,\" says Richard Whittle, author of <i>The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey</i>. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe advantages that the Osprey brings to the battlefield have been  displayed during deployment. Not only can V-22s carry larger payloads, but they can also cover more than four times the distance of the Sea Knight. For the Marines and special operators who rely on the Osprey's speed, those are crucial capabilities.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIn 2010, a helicopter was wrecked during a raid in Afghanistan, stranding dozens of special operations soldiers who came under attack from small arms and mortar fire. When other helicopters were turned back by dust storms and the high peaks of the Hindu Kush, two CV-22s made the 800-mile rescue, soaring 15,000 feet and over the mountains. The mission returned 32 U.S. personnel in less than 4 hours. A year later, an F-15 pilot who had crashed in Libya was rescued by MV-22s flying from an amphibious assault ship. The Marines returned the pilot to the vessel, 150 miles away, in just 30 minutes. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nU.S. Air Force Maj. Brian Luce, a pilot with the 8th Special Operations Squadron, flew the Osprey in Afghanistan and saw firsthand how it turned doubters into converts. \"Some of the guys have a little hesitancy,\" he says. \"But then they ride with us and get from point A to point B in record time.\" Luce says mission planners and combat commanders have also learned to appreciate the Osprey's capabilities. \"The range and speed of a CV-22 are phenomenal,\" he says. \"They are realizing this and are adjusting their tactics and procedures.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThose benefits come at a steep price. The V-22's research and development program was supposed to cost just over $39 billion, but independent estimates predict that it will come to $56 billion&#151;43 percent higher. This price tag&#151;about $100 million per plane, including development costs&#151;becomes a bull's-eye each time politicians look for budget cuts. The 2010 bipartisan deficit commission proposed termination of the Osprey in its list of suggested savings.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe White House's proposed 2013 budget trims 24 aircraft (from 122 to 98) over five years, saving $1.75 billion. But those orders could be reinstated during negotiations of the Pentagon's contract with Osprey maker Bell-Boeing. The fact that the Osprey has escaped the budget ax's deepest cuts confirms its improved reputation within the military.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nDespite its successes, the V-22 still has something to prove. Critics have found another source of ammunition to aim at the hybrid aircraft that everyone loves to hate.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/planes-uavs/the-ospreys-real-problem-isnt-safety-its-money-8347657-2\">A Mission Denied >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/VJ/osprey-02-0612-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-14T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Pappalardo","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8347657","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/military/planes-uavs/the-ospreys-real-problem-isnt-safety-its-money-8347657\">The Osprey's Real Problem Isn't Safety &mdash;It's Money</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/planes-uavs/how-safe-is-the-mv-22-osprey-8036684\">How Safe Is the MV-22 Osprey ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/best-aircraft-of-oshkosh-air-show-2011\">The Best Aircraft of Oshkosh Air Show 2011</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/2582051\">New Crash Raises Old Questions on V-22's Safety Record</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/4322772\">V-22 Osprey Debut Report Card: Analysis</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/planes-uavs/are-pilots-or-robots-the-future-of-naval-aviation\">Are Pilots&mdash;or Robots&mdash;the Future of Naval Aviation ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/aviation/crashes/air-france-447-and-the-limits-of-aviation-safety-10487501\">Air France 447 and the Limits of Aviation Safety </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/aviation/news/planes-of-the-paris-air-show\">The Planes of the Paris Air Show</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/six-wild-new-personal-aircraft\">6 Wild New Personal Aircraft </a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/military/planes-uavs/anatomy-of-a-special-operations-v-22-osprey\">Anatomy of a Special Operations V-22 Osprey </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:21:57.000Z","author_id":"5531","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/planes-uavs/the-ospreys-real-problem-isnt-safety-its-money-8347657","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"He gives you the biggest hugs, the smartest advice, and the most generous allowance.

Bikes consume most of my time outside of my day job as an audio engineer making promos for Fox Broadcasting. I'm a really organized person. That's essential in my work, and it's also why the club relies on me to plan our events. I like the nitty-gritty logistics, such as getting permits. To me it's not tedious; attending to the little things is satisfying.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Maybe that's why I like detailing. </strong></span>Everyone in the club likes a clean bike, except maybe Bubbles. He has a Triumph that would turn into a big bag of parts if he were to wash it.\n\n<br /><br /\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Vintage biking is not a utilitarian subculture.</strong></span> What people wear, how they wear it, their tattoos&#151;part of being in this scene is about sharing a particular aesthetic. There are other types of motorcyclists who could give a rat's tail about keeping things tight and neat. I can respect that. But just the same, I'm keeping my kit clean. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>I own four bikes: an '83 Suzuki GS1100E, </strong></span>a 2003 Yamaha YZF-R1, and a 1979 Yamaha SR500 for racing. The fourth is my vintage ride, a '68 Triumph TR6C Dual Sport Custom. It was my father's. He crashed it&#151;nothing serious, but after that it sat in our garage in pieces. When I finished high school, my parents asked me what I wanted for graduation. I said, \"Get the Triumph running!\" It's been a love affair ever since. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>I take a lot of crap for treating her </strong></span>like a trailer queen, which is a pretty motorcycle that's always in tow. But recently I've gotten past my OCD of over-protection by actually riding her. She's still gorgeous but a heck of a lot more fun!\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>I try to obey the rules of the road&#151;really, I do. </strong></span>But sometimes it's hard. I can peel through gears and get to speed faster than most cars. It's easy to get reckless with that kind of power in your hands.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Still, you have to respect the machine. </strong></span>You always keep its power in mind. Leave your ego at the curb or bad things could happen. In my opinion, respecting the machine means also taking care of it. A safe, well-maintained bike is priority No. 1; aesthetics are a close second. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Some guys spend a whole day </strong></span>on a detailing job. You get in the zone and time evaporates. But I can detail my bike in an hour if I put my mind to it. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>Yes, I own a car. And yes, I can make it</strong></span> as clean and shiny as my bike.

Hawaiian George Freeth&#151;who reinvigorated surfing by cutting his 16-foot redwood board to a more nimble 8 feet&#151;demonstrates his skills in this publicity stunt for the Redondo&#151;Los Angeles Railway.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1926:</strong></span> Tom Blake&#151;who was born in Wisconsin and later moved to Hawaii&#151;drills holes in his 15-foot-long redwood board to reduce its weight, then encases it in two other pieces of wood. His friends scoff at the \"Cigar Board,\" but in 1930 a version of his super-fast board becomes the first ever to be mass-produced. Seven years later, he publishes plans for a DIY board in PM.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1932:</strong></span> The introduction of balsa decreases surfing board weights from 100 to 30 pounds&#151;which makes impressing beach bunnies by hoisting a board overhead much easier.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1934:</strong></span> Hawaiian surfers taper the tail end of their boards; the new, more hydrodynamic design allows them to maneuver into the curl of the wave and ride in the pipe.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1935:</strong></span> Blake creates the fixed-tail fin, which increases maneuverability and stability. (Twin fins hit surfboards in the late '60s, triple fins in the early '80s.) \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1940S TO '50S:</strong></span>  Fiberglass, invented in the '30s, is used on surfboards after World War II. In the '50s, Hawaii's George Downing creates \"gun\" longboards: Shaved from polyurethane and finished in fiberglass, the narrow, lightweight boards are ideal for big-wave riding.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>\"My surfer knots are rising / And my board is losing wax / But that won't stop me, Baby / 'Cause you know I'm coming back&#133; Surfin' is the only life / The only way for me.\"</strong></span> &#151; BEACH BOYS, \"SURFIN',\" 1961 \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>1971:</strong></span> Sick of losing his board after wipeouts, Californian Pat O'Neill (son of wetsuit designer Jack) comes up with a DIY solution:</strong></span> suction cup + surgical cord = surf leash.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>FEBRUARY 2011:</strong></span> Spanish firms Tecnalia and Pukas equip a board with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, a GPS, and strain gauges to gather data. They find surfers experience up to 5 g's during sharp turns.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>NOVEMBER 2011:</strong></span> Hawaiian Garrett McNamara rides a 90-foot wave&#151;shattering the previous record, a mere 77 feet&#151;off the coast of Nazar&#233;, Portugal. \n\n<br /><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"><strong>2012:</strong></span> Global Surf Industries layers fiberglass and hand-laid coconut husks over an expanded polystyrene core to create a surfboard that is 25 percent lighter&#151;and 35 percent stronger&#151;than most other boards. Surfboards continue to get more high-tech, thanks to devices like the WaveJet, a water-propulsion system that attaches to the bottom of boards and allows surfers to cut through water at up to 7 mph. Using the device, McNamara paddled into a 45-foot wave; the only way to catch a breaker that big before was to be pulled in by jet ski.

The parking lot is packed with 4x4 pickups and other mud-splattered vehicles outfitted with surfboard and bike racks. I'm led inside the GoPro headquarters by Rick Loughery, the company's steel-jawed director of communications, who's wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \"manufacturing stoke.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe thread past a cube warren populated by twentysomethings dressed in the wrinkled cotton of passengers who just landed on the red-eye from Reykjav&#237;k (which some of the staffers very likely did). Duffel bags stuffed with outdoor gear crowd vacant desks while videographers stare into 27-inch monitors, editing footage captured at the most recent Winter X Games. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWe weave our way to an office, where Nick Woodman, the 36-year-old founder and CEO of the upstart camera company, is double-fisting cans of Red Bull&#151;his rocket fuel of choice&#151;and watching a high-definition cavalcade of GoPro-sponsored athletes leaping out of airplanes, tumbling off mountains, plummeting over waterfalls, and diving into hot tubs on every continent. The frenetic action has been stitched into a promotional video for the company's latest creation, the $300 HD Hero2, the culmination of a decade's worth of tiny, armored cameras designed to be mounted on bike handlebars, snowboard helmets, and car hoods. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWoodman's distillation of the essence of the GoPro mission is equal parts corporate messaging and surferspeak: \"Our goal was to create a celebration of inspired humans doing rad stuff around the world.\" In fact, Woodman is, to an extent, underselling the GoPro effect. The 8-year-old company not only has celebrated the antics of those inspired humans, it has also created a virtuous circle of video reinforcement that defines and motivates the culture of extreme sports. Woodman&#151;a wave rider, race-car driver, mountain biker, and snowboarder&#151;lives the lifestyle his indestructible cameras capture. He is proud that those cameras and accessories such as the new Wi-Fi BacPac, which adds remote capture and sharing features, form their own feedback loop that continuously adds functionality without stranding older equipment. The backward compatibility with cameras dating to the original HD Hero from 2009 keeps customers happy&#151;and the Lego-like upgrades encourage people to buy deeper into the GoPro system. That resulting combination of customer enthusiasm and loyalty sold more than 800,000 cameras last year to users who then upload videos to YouTube once every 2 &#189; minutes.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWoodman didn't set out to redefine the market for digital imaging. He just wanted to shoot decent surfing photos. In early 2002, after his games promotion company, Fun Bug, flamed out in the wake of the dot-com bust, he took off with his girlfriend (now wife), Jill, to surf-bum in Southeast Asia. The waves were world-class, and the art major from the University of California, San Diego, wanted to take high-quality action shots of his buddies on their boards. \"Surfing is such an incredible experience with a huge ego element,\" he says. \"'Did you see that wave? I got so barrelled! No? You didn't!'\" \n\n<br /><br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/technology/gopros-greatest-hits\"><img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/g1/gopro-hits-slideshow-495x170-061212.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoPros Greatest Hits\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br />\n\nBut unless you dragged a cameraman with a wide-angle lens into the tube with you, the best you could do was lash a disposable camera in waterproof housing to your arm with a rubber band. Woodman started thinking, what if I make a wrist strap with a mechanism that pivots the camera out of the way while I'm surfing, pop it up for the money shot, and then fold it down again? Between paddling out for sets in Sumatra and Java, he spent his time creating prototypes from old surf leashes. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nWhen he and Jill returned to California in August 2002, they spent three months traveling the coast, living out of Woodman's 1974 VW bus and selling bead-and-shell belts they had picked up for $1.90 apiece in Indonesia as $60 fashion accessories at concerts and flea markets. With the profits and a $35,000 family loan, Woodman continued refining his prototypes on his mother's sewing machine, moving back home to save money. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere was just one problem: The straps worked fine but the technology didn't. \"Every camera I used would flood or break after a big wipeout,\" he says. \"I realized I shouldn't be a strap company, but a camera company.\"\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWoodman didn't seem to understand that switching from the sports-accessory industry to the consumer-electronics business (which is dominated by huge companies such as Sony, Canon, Nikon, and Panasonic) is akin to going from intramural hoops to an NBA tryout. \"Most businesses that enter categories like this don't bootstrap with one dude going to Starbucks every morning to, like, get himself pumped up for the day, saying, 'I am doing this!'\" Woodman says, laughing at his lack of a strategic plan, team, or money. \"Looking back on it, it's crazy that we've gotten to where we are now.\" \n\n<br /><br />\n\nMaybe not. It's unlikely that the HD Hero would have emerged from a digital-imaging company. The industry's leaders were busy trying to stuff more bells, whistles, and megapixels into shiny cameras for the masses. No matter how obsessively he looked, Woodman could not find a camera he could transform into a tough-as-nails rig that would work in any kind of action. \"I went to all the major camera shows, walking every aisle, and I'm maniacal,\" he says, \"When I say I looked at every booth, I looked at every booth twice.\"\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3

Hence, bicycle helmets, the movie-rating system, and immunizations. But what about a different kind of discomfort &#151; say, when they get wind of adult situations like divorce or a serious illness? It may be tempting to fib and spare children the harsh truth, but a) that's sidestepping honesty and b) you won't be equipping your kid to deal with the hard stuff in life. And c) once your little one is more of a midsize to large one, she's going to be too observant to be sheltered from reality. So how's a parent to proceed? </p><p><b>Consider this:</b> \"Unlike adults, children don't have a context to put disturbing information into. Well-meaning parents may give kids more info than they can deal with, causing insecurity and anxiety they'd intended to control,\" says Edward Hallowell, M.D., a psychiatrist in Sudbury, MA, and New York City and author of several books on parenting, including <i>The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness.</i> So you'll want to parcel out the info in appropriate, manageable chunks. </p><p>You have to acknowledge there's been a disturbance in their universe, but keep the flow of information to a trickle. \"Kids need to know only what they need to know: what will change in their lives because of the situation and, more important, what won't change,\" says John Duffy, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and author of <i>The Available Parent: Radical Optimism for Raising Teens and Tweens.</i> \"You should discuss things differently with each child, based on his age and maturity and the situation itself.\" </p><p>So when your kid hears about something you wish he hadn't and comes to you asking for an explanation, give him the info he needs &#151; and not a bit more. </p>\n\n<p><b>Next: <a href=\"/family/parenting-tips/talking-to-your-kids-about-divorce\">How to talk to your kids about divorce</a></b></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-06-08T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"988517","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/Th/ghk-mother-daughter-talking-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Frankel","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372721","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/parenting-tips/talk-to-kids-apr06\">How to Talk So Your Kids Will Really Listen</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/talking-to-your-kids-about-tough-questions\">Answering the Trickiest Questions </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/marriage-sex/happy-kids-healthy-marriage\">How to Have Happy Kids by Working on Your Marriage</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/parenting-advice\">125 Ways to Be a Better Parent</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/talking-with-your-teen\">Talking with Your Teen About Sex, Drugs, and Money</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/budget/how-to-teach-kids-about-money\">How to Teach Kids the Value of a Dollar</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/children-healthy-lifestyle\">One Town Gets Children to Live a Healthy Lifestyle</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/toxic-friendships\">When Bad Friends Happen to Good Kids </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/womens-health/kids-monitoring-technology-mar07\">Do You Know Where Your Kids Are?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/parenting-tips/raising-children-discipline-advice\">How to Raise Respectful Children </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:40:05.000Z","author_id":"5302","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/parenting-tips/talking-to-your-kids-about-tough-questions","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Give your living room a make-over with Dulux","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"uk-mproctor","keywords":"refresh, Dulux, kitchen, decorate, diy, colour, design, paint","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Dulux living room challenge","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-07-04T14:23:45.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"641","teaser":"Give your living room a make-over with Dulux","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"<em>This is an All About You advertorial feature.</em> Give your living room a make-over with Dulux and create a welcoming family space...","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"Win a Makeover for your room with Dulux worth &#163;1000.\nallaboutyou.com &#150; The online home of Good Housekeeping, Prima, Coast, Country Living and House Beautiful.

My TV is in the living room&#151;across the house. What's the easiest way to bridge the two?<br /><br />","__total_count__":1,"sender":"","answer":"You need three things to transfer media across your home. The first is a media source, or server, which you already have&#151;your computer&#151;that has all the videos, music, and photos on it. The second thing you need is a receiver of some sort that supports the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA)  standard. If your TV is a relatively new \"smart\" TV equipped with Wi-Fi, it can probably act as a media receiver; if not, you'll need to attach an external one. The Western Digital WD TV Live Streaming Media Player is a good option and is available for about $100 on Amazon. It supports Netflix,  Spotify, and Hulu in addition to local file streaming. (More popular products, such as the Apple TV and the Roku box, can stream audio and video from online sources but can't play media files stored on a home network.) Both the Xbox 360 and  PlayStation 3 also support local media streaming, along with a full complement of Internet streaming services. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe third thing you need is a translator&#151;that is, software to take your media and make it visible to your streaming box. Windows can stream some  video types natively via a feature called Windows Media  Center, but you're far better off downloading a free app called  TVersity. This will make your media visible to any DLNA device or game console and, if necessary, convert the files to a format your device can read. (In order for this feature to work, you'll need a fast processor&#151;at least a Core 2 Duo.) As a bonus, TVersity can stream to your mobile devices, as long as they're connected to your home  Wi-Fi network.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nMac users using a DLNA TV or streaming box should download an app called TwonkyServer, which will immediately make your media collection visible to your streaming device. PS3 or Xbox owners will be better served by the now-free Rivet application, which will stream your content and also retain your computer's folder structure.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nWireless speed is also important. Even if your router claims to transfer data at a full 54 megabits per second&#151;the top speed of 802.11g routers, which is theoretically more than fast enough to stream an HD video&#151;signal fluctuations can reduce that data rate drastically. You don't really notice the difference when you're surfing the Web; you do notice it when you're subjecting the connection to a steady load. File-sharing apps such as BitTorrent are a common cause of speed  fluctuations, but distant router placement can cause problems, too. If your Wi-Fi video streams are getting choked, it might be time to consider upgrading to a faster 802.11n router or, better yet, rolling out some Cat 5e Ethernet cable.\n\n<br /><br

Wrong, says dermatologist Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., of High Point, NC, a consulting professor of dermatology at Duke University School of Medicine. \"A lot of people with thinning hair think, <i>Well, now I have to do a lot to it to make it look better. </i>So they get a bodybuilding perm, or they buy a special brush and give their hair a hundred strokes a day. But none of that is worthwhile.\" What <i>will</i> make a difference: these seven easy hair-care changes that you can begin today. </p><p><b>Don't fuss</b><br />Rather than brushing hair a hundred strokes a day, aim for the opposite: Brush your hair as little as possible. And choose a brush with broad-based bristles &#151; they don't snag hair. The less you handle your hair, the less damage you'll cause. </p><p><b>Shampoo at the roots</b><br />Its main purpose is to cleanse the scalp in order to prevent dandruff and infections. Shampoo actually damages the hair shaft, roughing up the cuticle, so scrubbing your hair will make it less, not more, beautiful. Instead, gently rub shampoo into your scalp, work it into a lather, and, when you're ready to rinse, run it through the rest of your hair with your hands. </p><p><b>Condition after every wash</b><br />This step makes locks smooth. If conditioner turns your strands limp, apply it only on your ends. In fact, conditioner should never go near the roots, which have enough of hair's natural conditioner (sebum). </p><p><b>Douse with dimethicone</b><br />This wonder ingredient, a silicone, coats each shaft and acts as a lubricant. By reducing friction between strands, it minimizes tangles and damage, a great protective benefit for thinning tresses. Dimethicone adds shine and cuts down on frizz as well. Because it's such a great smoothing agent, you'll find it in hair products from shampoos and conditioners to masks, but the heaviest dose is in styling products and treatments, like the winning L'anza and Biolage leave-ins.</p><p><b>Stick to a routine</b><br />Caring for your hair isn't a one-shot deal. The dimethicone and other smoothers your conditioner, mask, and/or styler leave behind last only till your next shampoo. So with every wash, you need to repeat. And for the silkiest, shiniest hair, deposit several thin layers of smoothers by using a daily or deep conditioner <i>and</i> a treatment or styling product (for example, pair the Pureology conditioner with the L'anza). </p><p><b>Don a hat in the sun</b><br />The pigment in your hair (natural or dyed) helps stop UV damage by absorbing radiation. Once you go gray, you lose that protection, and sunlight breaks down hair's protein. UV rays also can turn gray hair a funny yellow color. </p><p><b>Try leave-in sun protection</b><br />Your best defense against the sun, which also fades hair color, is to cover up with a hat, scarf, or umbrella. But if that's not possible, apply a leave-in conditioner with sun protection when hair is wet &#151; the water will help it spread evenly. Skip spray versions, which don't distribute as well.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-31T05:51:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"982931","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/lb/ghk-0911-woman-combing-hair-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":null,"source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8360102","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

to wash your hands of a guy who's no good? Then why not go a step further and flush him down the toilet? This is what hundreds of women are doing at an ancient Buddhist temple in Japan. Known as the \"divorce temple,\" Mantokuji Temple in the town of Ojimamachi helps women get rid of bad-relationship karma with the aid of a sacred latrine. Women write down their wish to sever their marriage ties on a piece of paper, then flush it to have their prayers answered.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Japan's rising divorce rate (up fourfold in the past 50 years), Mantokuji has become a pilgrimage site for unhappy wives. The Japanese believe that spiritual gods exist in everything &#151; even the john &#151; so the idea is to get the blessing of Kawaya No Kami, a toilet deity believed to live at the temple. Until a century ago, the temple served as a refuge for Japanese women who wanted to leave bad marriages but couldn't because only husbands could initiate divorce. Swishing their love woes down the pan today may be merely symbolic, but it's got to feel good.

YOU WERE TO CREATE THE IDEAL</strong> Asian woman, what would she look like? She would be thin, of course, and her skin would be pale, unlined, babyish in its softness and porelessness. Her hair would be thick, shiny, black or dark brown, preferably straight, and certainly long. You would be able to paint her in just two swipes of gouache, a figure as unspecific as she is iconic: a knife-slash blade of ink for her torso, a brushstroke of black for her hair.</p>\n<p>It would be an easy image to make because here's what you wouldn't need to bother rendering: hips (or girth of any kind, for that matter &#151; the idea of replacing the word <em>fat</em> with the more salubrious euphemism of <em>curvy</em> has never quite caught on among Asians); skin that shows the sorts of marks that all other races have grown to, if not celebrate, then at least accept (freckles, moles, sunspots, even the occasional wrinkle); short hair.</p>\n<p>There are 4.1 billion Asians in the world, or almost 60 percent of the entire human race. Some 17.3 million of them live in the United States. Asian cultures are some of the oldest on the planet. So why, given so much representation and centuries to, you know, expand our tastes, is the definition of Asian female beauty still this narrow? And &#151; here's where I get self-involved &#151; how do I accept the fact that I'll never have it?</p>\n<p>This is what I do know: I have never been the woman in that gouache painting. Like my mother and my grandmothers, I am stocky and muscular, and my skin is on the darker side. (My base color is about the shade of just-steeped Earl Grey.) When I was a girl, my hair was thick and floppy-straight, so slippery that elastic bands would slide right off of it. As I moved into my teens &#151; as penance for coveting curly hair? &#151; it first grew frizzy, then sullenly, unpredictably wavy. In my early 20s, it fell out in clumps along my crown for no diagnosable reason and never grew back. (I've become a master of the comb-over.) What bothers me more than my hair, though, is my skin: My face is speckled with sunspots, blackish welts, dozens of little imperfections. (I partly blame my mother, who, for an Asian woman, had a rather laissez-faire attitude toward sunscreen.) These are difficult to remove from darker skin &#151; lasers can mottle the area around them, leaving tiny daubs of white.</p>\n<p>Atypically, however, most of these things never really started bothering me until I entered my 30s. (I'm 37 now.) When I was a child, we lived in a small town in East Texas, where we were the only Asian family for miles, so I never really had the opportunity to compare myself to other Asian females. I simply looked different, and that difference, of race alone, blotted out any nuances. For all my classmates knew, I was what an Asian girl should look like. When I was 13, I left Texas to attend high school in Hawaii. There, so many people were Asian or part Asian &#151; Hawaii is populated with people whose ethnic genotypes could be jigsaws, they're so complicated &#151; that it was almost as if they had no choice but to opt out of the beauty system altogether. And good for them.</p>\n<p>But then I grew up, moved to New York for my first job, and things began to change.</p>\n<p>Now, I've never been the sort of person who thought that the media or the fashion industry were to blame for girls' eating disorders, or for setting unachievable standards. One of the things about living in New York is you realize that, actually, some women really do look like the women in the ads. I did, however, begin to notice how similar &#151; almost identical &#151; to one another the few Asian women I saw on-screen and the runways really were. Indeed, I'd argue that the range of beauty for Asian women is far narrower than for black women, in which everyone from Beyonc&#233; to Alek Wek to Halle Berry to Queen Latifah is considered lovely. And for Latinas, Eva Longoria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and America Ferrera &#151; all different in size and skin tone &#151; set the standard. Now close your eyes and envision which Asians we consider beautiful &#151; Lucy Liu, Zhang Ziyi, Michelle Yeoh, Liu Wen, Gianna Jun, Padma Lakshmi &#151; and then reacquaint yourself with the checklist at the top of this piece: check, check, and check.</p>\n<p>It'd be so much easier if I could blame this narrowness of vision on, say, American beauty standards; if I could chalk it up to a corruption of something lost in translation. But I can't. Asians in Asia define beauty by the same limiting parameters, something I discovered the first time I went there. (I'm a fourth-generation American, but my family is from Japan.) It was the mid-'90s, and I'd gone to visit a friend who'd just relocated to Tokyo. I instantly fell in love with it. And yet, for the first time, I was made vividly, uncomfortably aware of how I stuck out. In random moments, I would catch a glimpse of myself in a window and realize how much bigger, darker, <em>lesser</em> I was than everyone else. Only racists and reductionists think all Japanese people look the same &#151; they don't &#151; but there were times when it sure seemed like it.</p>\n<p>I had never thought of myself as particularly attractive, but nor had I often felt self-conscious about my looks. Being an \"other\" in an all-white environment was one thing: I didn't want to look white, and what's more, I couldn't. But being an \"other\" on a street &#151; in a city, in a country, on a continent &#151; full of Asians felt like a rebuke: Here was what I should look like, and in each person was a reminder of how I didn't. It sounds ridiculous, but I felt in those moments as if I had failed, and the feeling was one of embarrassment and apology.</p>\n<p><strong>I WISH I COULD SAY</strong> that in the intervening 15 years between that first trip and now, I've learned to accept that I simply will never be considered beautiful by these prohibitive standards, while at the same time realizing the impossibility of them. But that hasn't happened at all.</p>\n<p>Instead, it seems that I am increasingly bombarded with evidence of how I'm failing, and I'm ever more acutely attuned to it. It's actually easier to forget about my shortcomings in America, where the sheer diversity of people (and the sheer busyness of life) makes the opportunities for such comparisons more difficult. But my job requires frequent trips to Asia, and it's there that I'm most keenly aware of how I do not, and cannot, fit in. Let's be clear: I wouldn't trade the qualities I know I do have for beauty. But every time I'm in Tokyo, looking for a size 8, and am directed to the equivalent of the plus-size floor; or am in Beijing and am instantly picked out as an American for the color of my skin or the thickness of my calves; or am asked, sweetly and without malice, by a rice-paper-skinned aesthetician in Bangkok why my skin has so many blotches, something in me withers and weeps.</p>\n<p>So what's the solution? Avoiding Asia altogether? Getting myself sucked and bleached and plugged into something that won't end up looking right anyway? Or is it just plain old self-acceptance? In Buddhism, a religion I was raised with, one is taught in part to not covet what is unachievable. In Japan, that sentiment is interpreted and embodied in the phrase <em>\"shikata ga nai\"</em> &#151; it can't be helped. And although purists might argue that this sounds more like resignation than acceptance, its intended effect &#151; toward peace, not yearning &#151; is the same. Next month, I go to Asia again, and I intend to try it when I feel like a freak, a blight in a field of lilies: <em>Shikata ga nai, shikata ga nai, shikata ga nai.</em></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-30T17:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Yoshiwara","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8471950","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/asian-beauty-secrets\">Beauty , Redefined</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/armani-beauty-beijing-show\">Backstage Pass: Armani in Asia Minor</a><br>\n<a href=\"/world-reports/news/ethnicity-extreme-makeover\">What Some Women Will Do for Beauty </a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/celebrity-tips/jean-chung\">Photojournalist Jean Chung's Beauty Arsenal</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/sleep-best-products\">Sleeping Beauties</a><br>\n<a href=\"/world-reports/news/hong-kong-date-rape-drug-rohypnol-men\">Dangerous Liaisons</a><br>\n<a href=\"/muslim-wedding\">My Big Fat Muslim Wedding</a><br>\n<a href=\"/world-reports/charity/breast-cancer-awareness-products\">Products to Benefit Breast Cancer Research</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/women/beauty-phoenix\">What I Love About Me: Phoenix, AZ</a><br>\n<a href=\"/hair-beauty/trends/women/santa-fe-new-mexico-women-beauty\">What I Love About Me: Santa Fe, NM</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T17:30:55.000Z","author_id":"38042","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"marieclaire","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Marie Claire","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com/hair-beauty/trends/asian-beauty-secrets","issue_date":"05/01/2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Kylie and Kendall are <em>Seventeen</em>'s new West Coast Fashion Contributors!

He takes it from the linen closet, dries the boy, and puts it on the hook behind our son's door. Instead of reaching for this barely used towel after the next bath, he takes a new one, which he then hangs on top of the previous ones.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When I talk to him about it, I outline exactly why this makes me so frustrated and ask clearly and lovingly for what I need: For him to remember to bring a towel from our son's bedroom to the bath so there will always be enough clean towels for the rest of us, and we can do laundry less often, which will save us time and money.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Each time we talk, he agrees to my request. So why, when he is caught not doing the very thing he has agreed to do, am I greeted not with an appropriate word like <em>sorry, </em>but with a horrible, totally inaccurate word like <em>nag</em>? I don't think I nag. I remind! I suggest!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Let's remember, too, that nagging is inherently a chauvinistic word, used for women but never for men. My husband argues that this is because men don't do it. I say it's because women comply with requests the first time.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Yet... I hear myself--reminding, suggesting--and wonder, <em>When did I become this person?</em> Because just between us, I can admit it: I do nag. It's the simple request to take pictures of the kids more often so the burden isn't on me. It's the frustrated plea to put the medicine away out of the reach of the children, and so we know where it is when we're awakened by a baby with a fever. It's a gentle reminder to hit SAVE so I don't have to hear middle-of-the-night cursing as my husband's 2,000-word document disappears into the ether. It's the little things I need help with, the small tasks so innumerable that they'll never get done, if not with some assistance.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong--my husband can be excellent at anticipating my needs. He often wakes up early to make a family dinner so that all I have to do is reheat it 12 hours later. But the needs he hasn't anticipated, the ones I have to ask for, seem impossible for him to meet.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Maybe the asking itself is the problem. Every interaction between two people has two dimensions, according to Deborah Tannen, a linguistics professor at Georgetown University and the author of <em><a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=H9jnWouJtVA&subid=&offerid=239662.1&type=10&tmpid=8432&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%252Fw%252Fyou-just-dont-understand-deborah-tannen%252F1001864034%253Fean%253D9780060959623\" target=\"_blank\">You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation</a>.</em> One dimension: Is this interaction bringing us closer together or pushing us farther apart? More aptly, the other is: Who's in a one-up or one-down position? \"Those who have studied kids at play have observed that boys' groups are more obviously hierarchical,\" Tannen says. \"If you tell someone to do something and he obliges, your status is up. If you take orders, your status is low.\" So that means when I ask my husband to do something, he might perceive that he's being taken down a notch. I'm not sure what to do with this, and Tannen doesn't offer me anything beyond telling me to bite my tongue. But at least I have one theory as to why an intelligent, liberal-minded man is so stubbornly refusing to honor the tiny wishes of the wife he loves.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>\"The laws of logic don't apply to nagging,\" says economics journalist Paula Szuchman, coauthor of <em>It's Not You, It's the Dishes. </em>\"You think saying something over and over will motivate the person to do it. But if you're just nagging me and I don't feel any reward for doing it, the only reward is not being nagged. Is that really a reward?\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Szuchman advises me to trust that my husband knows what I want and to wait for it to happen: \"People are motivated by trust. If they feel trusted, they're more likely to do something.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But I already have empirical proof that if I do nothing, it won't get done. This is how we got here! Szuchman points out that I don't have proof that isn't bookended by nagging.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>So I'm just supposed to wait?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" says Szuchman, who is also married. \"It's absurd.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1034665","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/lH/rbk-nagging-0612-2-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Brodesser-Akner","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8223111","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

summer there are <em>five</em> bank holidays. Which would be great if it weren&#146;t for the fact that while you&#146;re kicking back at the Queen&#146;s behest, the huge pile of work you left on your desk is waiting for you. A <a href=\"http://www.regus.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">recent poll</a> found that almost half of us now take work home. Is there even such a thing as a free day off?</p>\n\n<p>Of course there is. You just have to be on it when the bunting comes down. That&#146;s where dinner comes in &#150; eat this dish the night before work and you&#146;ll be primed. Chicken is a source of B vitamins, which help to convert carbs into energy. And a study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> found that vitamin C in the lime could play a vital role in brain and eye function &#150; lending you laser focus all day long.</p>\n\n<h2>The arsenal (serves 4)</h2>\n<p>1.5-2kg whole free-range chicken\n<br />4 sweet potatoes, cut into chips\n<br />3 tbsp coriander, chopped\n<br />1 lime\n<br />2-3 garlic cloves, chopped\n<br />Olive oil \n<br />1 tbsp light soy sauce</p>\n\n<h2>The battle plan</h2>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C. Mix the coriander, 2tbsp lime juice, <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/superfoods/a-beginners-guide-to-superfood\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Health benefits of garlic\">garlic</a>, olive oil and some salt and pepper (in a blender if you have one). Place the chicken in a roasting tray and brush over your oil mix. Cover with foil and place in the oven.</p>\n<p>While the chicken is roasting, mix salt and zest from half the lime in a bowl and toss with the chips, some oil and the soy sauce. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and return the chicken to the oven for another 20 minutes, reducing the temperature to 175-180&#176;C.</p>\n<p>Then add the <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/what-to-eat/regular-spud-vs-sweet-potato-854b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Health benefits of sweet potatoes\">sweet potato</a> and roast the lot for another 20-30 minute. You&#146;ll know it&#146;s fully cooked if the juices run clear when the bird is pierced in the thigh with a skewer.</p>\n<p>Now serve it up with one of our fit-for-purpose salsas:</p>\n\n<h2>The secret weapon</h2>\n<p>Mix all ingredients with 3tbsp oil and a pinch each of salt and sugar</p>\n<p><strong>For calm: <font color=\"#e2ad00\">Pico de Gallo</font></strong> Juice from 1 lime; 2 garlic cloves; 400g tomatoes; 1 tsp jalapen&#771;o pepper; 3tbsp coriander; 1 red onion (all finely chopped). The pepper&#146;s capsaicin relaxes blood vessels, helping to ease work tension.</p>\n<p><strong>For memory: <font color=\"#e2ad00\">Salsa verde</font></strong> 2 tbsp capers; 1&#8260;2 green pepper; 2 tsp garlic; 2 tbsp onion; 3 tbsp parsley (all finely chopped). Gargantuan to-do list? Studies suggest eating garlic regularly can protect your brain from plaques that impair memory.</p>\n<p><strong>For focus: <font color=\"#e2ad00\">Carrot salsa</font></strong> 2 carrots, cubed; 250g papaya, cubed; 3 tsp white wine vinegar. If you have a day of spreadsheet spotting, this vitamin A-heavy salsa will keep your eyes sharp, helping you to concentrate.</p>\n\n<p><em><font size=\"1\">Photography: Johanna Parkin; Food Styling: Maud Eden<br />Recipe: Sara la Fountain</font></em><font size=\"1\"><br />Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-05-25T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-evanstone","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8310082","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/food-nutrition/fatigue-fighting-chicken-and-chips\">Fatigue -fighting chicken and chips </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/two-chickens-one-day\">Five ways to eat two chickens a day</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/one-pot-winter-healthy-meals\">Health-boosting one-pot meals</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/Snack-off-Chicken-vs-Pork\">Snack off: Chicken vs Pork</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/bbq-busters-10110\">BBQ busters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fitness/ryans-final-marathon-blog-484140\">Ryan's final marathon blog</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/muscle-foods/think-big-kebab-227307\">Think big kebab</a><br>\n<a href=\"/blogs/my-pre-bulk-up-weekly-diet\">My pre-bulk-up weekly diet</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/back-to-your-future\">Back to your future</a><br>\n<a href=\"/living/reviews/belowzero-215814\">Belowzero</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"May '12 p75","print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2013-02-05T12:35:20.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-04-23T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/healthy-recipes/fatigue-fighting-chicken-and-chips","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Hey, you're not always going to have a bottle opener at the ready.

But his principle of leverage is the basis for the classic metal bottle opener&#151;and also works with an odd variety of objects.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nPut a one-handed stranglehold on the bottleneck, and use a [1] <strong>DISPOSABLE PLASTIC LIGHTER</strong> (a longtime fave) or a [2] <strong>USB DRIVE</strong> as a lever (and a knuckle as a fulcrum) to pop the top&#151;and learn a refreshing lesson in applied physics.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nAn old standby (with a high spill factor): Place the bottle top in a door's [3]<strong> METAL STRIKE PLATE,</strong> letting the crown catch on an inside edge; pull back on the bottle.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe squarish opening of a [4] <strong>CAR SEATBELT LATCH</strong> works surprisingly well. Never try this in a moving vehicle.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nPosition the fang-like teeth of a [5] <strong>STAPLE REMOVER</strong> under the crown and gently pull up, working your way around the cap until it's loose enough to pull off. This \"uncrimping\" can also be used with a [6] <strong>METAL NAIL FILE</strong> or a [7] <strong>KEY</strong>.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOf course, your emergency beer-bottle-opening tool kit can include, you know, real tools: A [8] <strong>FLAT-HEAD SCREWDRIVER</strong> decrimps nicely, as do [9] <strong>WIRE CUTTERS,</strong> standard [10] <strong>PLIERS</strong>&#151;or, better yet, those of the [11] <strong>NEEDLE-NOSE</strong> variety. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThere is a brute-force alternative to decrimping for those lacking patience or manual dexterity. Clamp the bottle between your thighs and apply upward thrust to the cap's lip with the edge of a [12] <strong>METAL RASP,</strong> a [13] <strong>BUBBLE LEVEL,</strong> or an electronic gadget, like an early [14] <strong>IPOD NANO</strong>. And if you're comfortable with a sturdy pair of [15] <strong>SCISSORS</strong> buzzing in your fly zone...\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA [16] <strong>RING</strong> can open a bottle, too. (Not your wedding band, pal&#151;soft metals like gold easily pit and bend.) Hook your finger over the top of the bottle, making sure the ring catches on the cap, and push up (or pull down) until it dislodges. This may hurt; but on the other hand: beer.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nSwing the gate of a large [17] <strong>CARABINER </strong>inside and use it to gain a purchase on the bottom of the crown; with the spine hooked over the cap, firmly pull up. [18] <strong>COUNTERTOP</strong> Hook the cap's lip on the edge of a hard countertop (not, God forbid, on an antique sideboard) and rap the cap with the heel of your palm. This also works on a [19] <strong>SHARP-EDGED BOULDER,</strong> or a [20] <strong>BELT BUCKLE,</strong> in which case, be careful where and how hard you strike.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<strong>! Please Don't!</strong>\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe above methods&#151;PM-field-tested and -approved&#151;represent the spectrum of ways to defeat those serrated-metal impediments to sudsy succor. But there are less-advisable techniques available for viewing online: Grip the bottle and carefully move the crown edge toward the spinning wheel of an upended bicycle, until a spoke catches and pops off the cap. Place the cap edge on the inside of your bottom row of molars, bite down, and pull the bottle up and away. Last and least advised: Hold the beer on the ground betwixt your boots, fire up a chain saw, and close in until a single chain tooth catches the bottom of the cap. Bring a change of underwear, and make sure your estate is in order.\n\n<br /><br

What sane, adoring husband would hold her hand through a pregnancy and delivery, all to make someone else a father? The questions dogged me as I picked up the phone to call Jeremy Wallace, a 35-year-old former Air Force staff sergeant who helped his wife fulfill her dream of becoming a surrogate mother. It was easier than I expected to find Jeremy and other husbands in his position: The number of men who've helped their wives give birth to children for other families, while certainly small, is growing. In 2008, there were 1,395 children born by gestational surrogacy (in which the woman carries the child, but is not the egg donor) in the United States. That's nearly double the number from 2004, according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. And many surrogates are married.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The husbands of these women tend to be middle-class, Midwestern fathers in their 30s, experts say. They are \"confident and supportive,\" says Elaine Gordon, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who has worked with surrogates for over 20 years and wrote a book for children born through surrogacy, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mommy-Did-Grow-Your-Tummy/dp/0963456105\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mommy, Did I Grow in Your Tummy? </em></a>John Weltman of Circle Surrogacy, an agency in Boston, goes one step further, describing these husbands as \"some of the most remarkable men you will ever meet.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Certainly, they are crucial to helping thousands of couples have children. No reputable agency will let a married woman become a surrogate unless her husband--who has to undergo psychological and financial screening--gives his written consent. His involvement is too important to the process for him to be anything less than fully on board, says Weltman: \"I've heard extraordinary stories of men who have literally saved the day. He has to be in it.\" There can be medical emergencies and months of bed rest, in addition to givens like the twice-daily hormone shots these guys have to inject into their wives before they even get pregnant.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>My knee-jerk suspicions melted away the more I talked to Jeremy, who comes across as not only sane, but sincere and well-adjusted. With broad shoulders and a charming Southern drawl, he still has the steady demeanor of a soldier (he served in the Air Force for 10 years). Jeremy left military life in 2006, and since then, he's worked at a variety of jobs, ultimately starting an appliance-repair business in San Antonio, where he lives with his wife, Dawn. They met when Dawn moved to Texas 16 years ago, and have been together ever since. It was a whirlwind romance, he tells me: They met in August, were engaged by Christmas, pregnant (surprise!) by January, and married in June. Today they have two daughters--Alexis, 14, and Rae-Lynn, 10--plus a niece (Amanda, 15) whom they adopted from Dawn's brother. Clearly, the Wallaces believe in family.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>An idea is born</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>The couple's path to surrogacy began in 2003. Dawn's close friend Amber was having trouble conceiving, and \"I offered to be an egg donor,\" says Dawn, a 5-foot-2-inch brunette with a warm, homespun presence. Jeremy gave his tacit approval, but Amber eventually became pregnant on her own. For Dawn, though, the idea of helping another couple have a baby had taken root. \"Watching Amber go through all those emotional ups and downs was so hard,\" she says. \"I thought, <em>I could help someone else</em>.\" She started researching surrogacy online.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>After months of perusing articles and websites, she was ready to share her secret with Jeremy. \"She was on the computer with all this information up on the screen, and she told me she was thinking about it,\" Jeremy recalls. \"My first reaction was, 'Okay, that's kind of a shock,' because she's going from [the idea of] donating eggs for a friend to actually wanting to carry a child for somebody else.\" Jeremy knew how much a baby means to a couple who can't have children--he was adopted, and his parents had been in that very situation. But still, \"that's a big leap,\" he says. They began to talk about the logistics of surrogacy, and naturally, finances came up. At the time, they were bringing in about $38,000 a year, so the $25,000 they'd get from Dawn's surrogacy--even if they'd lose almost half of it to taxes--represented a significant sum.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But the thought of his wife using her own eggs to produce a child with another man--even if there was no sex involved--and then carrying and delivering that child? It was still hard for Jeremy to grasp. \"I felt like there wasn't any difference between that and a guy sleeping with her,\" he says. \"I couldn't get over it at first.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-24T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1032413","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/7E/rbk-surrogate-wife-0612-1-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Quenqua","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"llevine","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8223118","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/mom/my-wife-was-a-surrogate-mother\">\"My Wife Was a Surrogate \"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/only-30-of-infertile-african-american-women-ever-seek-help-video-1212096704001\">\"Only 30% of infertile African-American women ever seek help.\" Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/marissa-jaret-winokur-video-1223226522001\">Marissa Jaret Winokur Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship-278179\">Signs of a Codependent Relationship</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/kids-teach-happiness-hl\">What Our Kids Teach Us About Happiness</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage-makeovers/marriage-makeover-0106\">Marriage Makeover: \"Our marriage's angel\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/love-sex/advice/marriage/secrets-to-happy-marriage\">19 Secrets to a Happy Marriage</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/advice/living-with-autism-0208\">Living with Autism: \"Losing My Little Boy\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/inspiration-wellness/intuition-strategies\">Intuition 101</a><br>\n<a href=\"/kids-family/surrogacy-adoption-pregnancy-story\">This Couple Had 3 Babies in One Year (and They're Not Triplets)</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"headline_image_id":"1032412","print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:21:58.000Z","author_id":"11755","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/kids-family/advice/my-wife-was-a-surrogate-mother","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Katy Perry takes us behind the scenes in 'Part Of Me'","site_id":"603","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"katy perry, teenage dream, behind the scenes, singer, trailer, russell brand, part of me, film, 3D","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Does Katy Perry reveal all in movie role?","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-05-23T09:58:52.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebrity-gossip/katy-perrys-divorce-addressed-in-extended-movie-trailer-2","link_text":"Katy Perry's divorce addressed in extended movie trailer"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/watch-katy-perry-in-the-part-of-me-film-trailer","link_text":"WATCH: Katy Perry in the 'Part Of Me' trailer"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/love-sex/russell-and-katy-on-the-rocks","link_text":"Is it over for Katy Perry and Russell Brand ?"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/celebs/katy-russell-in-film-together-3","link_text":"Katy &amp;

gas, constipation and acid reflux, digestive issues are among the most unpleasant ailments&#151;and the touchiest topics to broach. But getting to the root of your problems can ease discomfort and allay embarrassing symptoms. Learn how to tame your tummy with these eight astounding facts about your digestive tract.</p>\n<p><strong>We really are what we eat. </strong></p>\n<p>Bacteria from our intestines influence our digestive tract&#146;s health, according to Gerard Mullin, MD, professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Inside-Tract-Digestive-Health/dp/1605292648\" target=\"_blank\">The Inside Tract: Your Good Gut Guide to Great Digestive Health</a></em>. These friendly organisms break down hard-to-digest foods, produce nutrients and help keep harmful bacteria in check. When the balance of good guys versus bad falls out of whack&#151;because of antibiotics, too much junk food or even stress&#151;you can develop gas, bloating, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Too much bad bacteria is even linked to obesity, according to some research. Why? They stop the stomach from telling the brain it&#146;s full. To keep your belly&#146;s ecosystem thriving, eat plenty of fruit, vegetables and whole grains. These soluble fiber&#150;rich foods stimulate good bacteria growth as they move through your intestines, giving you a healthy gut and immune system, says Dr. Mullin. Yogurt and probiotic supplements can also fortify your defenses.</p>\n<p><strong>When you&#146;re stressed, your stomach is, too.</strong></p>\n<p>There&#146;s a reason your belly clenches at the sound of bad news. Your gastrointestinal tract is directly wired to the nervous system, explains Dr. Mullin. When your body perceives danger, your nervous system shuts down blood flow to the stomach so it can direct all its energy toward self-defense, says Brenda Powell, MD, a physician at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. &#147;When stress is chronic, the body releases inflammatory chemicals, which can break down the GI system&#146;s lining and function,&#148; she adds. To restore harmony, de-stress with meditation, exercise, yoga or spending time with supportive friends. And if you&#146;re in the middle of a stress attack, take slow, deep belly breaths to calm down.</p>\n<p><strong>Even a lot</strong> <strong>of gas</strong> <strong>is normal.</strong></p>\n<p>Most people think they break wind more often than their neighbor, when in fact they aren&#146;t setting any records. According to gastroenterologist Anish Sheth, MD, author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Your-Poo-Telling-You/dp/0811857824\" target=\"_blank\">What&#146;s Your Poo Telling You</a></em>, the average person sounds the horn 14 to 23 times a day, releasing up to four pints of gas. Still, if flatulence is putting a damper on social gatherings, Dr. Sheth recommends refraining from beans, cabbage, apples, sweet potatoes, carrots, prunes and other foods high in soluble fiber (yes, those same ones that are good for your gut) for up to six hours before your outing. Or take a probiotic pill like Culturelle or Align.</p>\n<p><strong>There&#146;s a reason you feel ill after eating greasy food.</strong></p>\n<p>Big, greasy meals can trigger the gastrocolic reflex&#151;your intestines&#146; way of cleaning house before new guests arrive. &#147;Fat turbo-charges the colon,&#148; causing forceful contractions, says Dr. Sheth. The result: Food that hasn&#146;t left your belly gets the heave-ho, sending you scuttling for the nearest bathroom. How do you stop this gut reaction? Stick with small meals, and keep oily indulgences to a minimum, says Dr. Sheth.</p>\n<p><strong>Eating too much and being overweight are the top reasons for GERD.</strong></p>\n<p>One out of five Americans suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease, aka GERD or acid reflux. While certain foods trigger heartburn and nausea, the most common cause of GERD is abdominal pressure from overeating, being overweight or both, says Dr. Sheth. In fact, your odds of getting acid reflux climbs as your weight does, even if your body mass index (BMI) is where it should be. Someone with a normal BMI of 22.5 is more at risk for GERD than someone with a lower BMI, according to David Johnson, MD, past president of the American College of Gastroenterology. That&#146;s why he tells GERD sufferers to drop three to five pounds, even if they&#146;re not overweight. Some people, especially those on the heavier side, may need to lose more to end symptoms, but even modest weight loss can help, says Dr. Johnson.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor diet is the most common cause of constipation.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling a bit bound up? You&#146;re not alone. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, constipation is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal complaints in the U.S., with at least 2.5 million doctor visits each year. In most cases, a low-fiber diet is to blame. If you don&#146;t get anywhere near the recommended 25 grams of fiber, increase your intake gradually over two to three weeks and drink plenty of water while you do. Here&#146;s one menu to meet the daily requirement: 1/4 cup black beans (3g); 1 cup shredded wheat (5g); two slices of whole-wheat bread (4g); apple (3g); orange (3g); &#189; cup cooked brown rice (2g); &#189; cup cooked spinach (2g); and &#189; cup of peas (4g). For a quick fix, opt for supplements, suggests Larry Schiller, MD, President-elect of the American College of Gastroenterology. Insoluble fiber supplements, like Metamucil, psyllium husk or Unifiber, work best.</p>\n<p><strong>The more slowly food moves through your belly, the longer you&#146;ll stay full.</strong></p>\n<p>Your body processes food in order of its complexity. Low-fiber and -protein simple carbohydrates, like white bread, rice and pasta, zip through your system quickly. While they might give you a shot of energy, the effects are short-lived, leaving you hungry again soon. Conversely, foods high in protein or fiber stick around longer, keeping you full longer. According to Bonnie Taub-Dix, M.A., R.D., author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Read-Before-You-Eat-Healthiest/dp/B004LQ0EK0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1335391581&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Read It Before You Eat It</a></em>, eating well-balanced meals and snacks will satisfy hunger quickly, so you don&#146;t devour as much, and will fill you up, so you&#146;re less likely to hit the vending machine in an hour. Good choices for filling snacks: apple slices with peanut butter, carrot sticks with hummus and almonds with dried fruit. Munch on these instead of junk and digestive problems linked to overeating and being overweight probably won&#146;t bother you anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Bland diets aren&#146;t the best treatment for acid reflux.</strong></p>\n<p>Some doctors tell GERD patients to stay away from favorite foods and drinks like chocolate, wine, spaghetti sauce, citrus and more. &#147;There&#146;s little evidence that those global restrictions make a difference,&#148; says Dr. Johnson. So you don&#146;t necessarily need to nix your top treats. Still, Dr. Johnson recommends refraining from eating anything you know gives you trouble. Avoiding big, fatty meals three to four hours before bedtime can also help curb symptoms.&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-21T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"983388","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/vu/woman-hands-stomach-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Provost","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mmajor","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8385127","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-05-21T15:54:51.000Z","author_id":"16940","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-04-26T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/health-fitness/conditions-diseases/digestive-problems","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"<em>Seventeen</em> joined forces with Tyra Banks to find the most Fiercely Real girls in America.

But, at high school, she admits her look was less than original.</p>\n<p>In a recent magazine interview she 'fessed up that her teen wardrobe consisted of baggy Tommy Hilfiger shirts and Hugo Boss jeans until a chance meeting with someone who &#147;dressed like a tiny lady &#151; pant suits, heels, lots of makeup&#148; inspired her to get experimental with her look.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Nicki Minaj and OPI collab\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/beauty-hair/news/beauty-news/nicki-minaj-and-opi?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">NICKI MINAJ AND OPI COLLABORATE</a></p>\n<p>&#147;I had never seen myself made up before. I didn&#146;t want to wash it off... I felt like I had one day to live this fantasy of being a glamour girl.&#148;</p>\n<p>She&#146;s definitely done that! Nicki Minaj&#146;s style is vibrant and eclectic: all cartoonish makeup, candy-coloured wigs, Jessica Rabbit eyelashes, sexy bustiers, minuscule skirts and the most OHMYGOD shoes imaginable. She&#146;s taken a little bit of everything she loves most &#150; Barbies, unicorns, candyfloss, Marilyn Monroe, Lady Gaga and Harajuku girls &#150; and made it her signature style.</p>\n<p>And, despite changing her look on a day to day basis, Nicki is always instantly recognisable &#150; she totally owns her fun style.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Love it or loathe it\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/love/love-it-or-loathe-it-nicki-minaj-pink-barbie?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">LOVE IT OR LOATHE IT: NICKI MINAJ</a></p>\n<p>So how can we follow suit and get brave with our looks?</p>\n<p>Well, as Nicki said to MTV News, it&#146;s all about focusing on yourself and NOT what everybody else says:</p>\n<p>\"Whether you follow Nicki Minaj's blueprint or not, just don't be afraid to experiment and don't allow people to knock your hustle just 'cause it ain't something that you're used to seeing.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/cm/cosmopolitanuk/images/xy/Carrie-Bradshaw-Audrey-ibK4ft-Hepburn.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"RIGHT\" /><strong>Get iconic</strong><br />Everybody needs a style icon. Nicki gets her fashspiration from Harajuku girls through to Barbie dolls. Try making a style inspiration board on <a title=\"Pinterest\" href=\"http://pinterest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a> to collate your most inspirational images!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Cosmopolitan / Pinterest\" href=\"http://pinterest.com/cosmopolitanuk/\" target=\"_blank\">COSMO ON PINTEREST</a></p>\n<p>Next, work out how best to channel these into your own eclectic look. Whether it&#146;s Marilyn Monroe&#146;s sexy red pout or Audrey Hepburn&#146;s Breakfast At Tiffany&#146;s glamour you can make these yours; it doesn&#146;t have to be quite as OTT as Nicki&#146;s looks either, if you don&#146;t want to.</p>\n<p>Make like Carrie Bradshaw and work a little Holly Golightly into your everyday look&#133;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Me, myself and I</strong><br />Treat fashion and beauty trends as a pick &#145;n&#146; mix sweety counter, rather than pursuing one particular look. It's about having fun with your fashion and tapping into trends that suit you.</p>\n<p>What about retro red lips with ripped jeans and a slouchy tee? Or pretty makeup toughened up with a leather jacket and studded biker boots?</p>\n<p><a title=\"Kristen Stewart Style CV\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/celebrity-style-cv/kristen-stewart-style-cv?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">KRISTEN STEWART STYLE CV</a></p>\n<p>Style icon <a title=\"The many looks of Kristen Stewart\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/the-many-looks-of-kristen-stewart-103381?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">Kristen Stewart</a> is a fan of the pick &#145;n&#146; mix trend; she loves to dress her glammest party frocks up with beaten-up converse and a battered leather jacket. Even her on-screen alter ego, Bella, donned a pair of silver converse with her wedding dress for <a title=\"Twilight Breaking Dawn Sneak peek\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/sneak-peek-the-teaser-trailer-for-twilight-breaking-dawn-part-two?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">Twilight: Breaking Dawn &#150; Part 1</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>I can sing a rainbow...</strong><br />Make sure that, like Nicki, you know your colour palette; while Minaj is a fan of every colour under the rainbow &#150; especially pink &#150; and knows that she looks awesome in bright bold hues and patterns. In love with red? Wear red! Is green your scene?</p>\n<p><a title=\"Get the celebrity look\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/get-the-look-a-list-style?click=main_sr#fbIndex1\" target=\"_blank\">GET THE CELEBRITY LOOK</a></p>\n<p>Rock out in a pair of emerald shoes &#150; do NOT let what&#146;s in style influence your palette. Take a step back from black; standing out is the key here. But do take note of which colours suit you best &#150; if yellow leaves you looking more melon than mellow, back away.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>If you&#146;ve got it, flaunt it!</strong><br />Nicki knows that her hourglass figure is absolutely to-die-for, which is why she shows it off in figure-hugging dresses and corsets. Those curves, no matter where she&#146;s going, are sure to be on display.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Katy Perry Style CV\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/katy-perrys-style-cv-109418?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">KATY PERRY STYLE CV</a></p>\n<p>Take a look at your own figure and work out what you like best and then dress around that! Whether you opt for waist-nipping pencil skirts, flirty leg-tastic minis or ankle-teasing midi-skirts, everyone has something in their figure to make the centrepoint of their outfit. If you&#146;ve got it, flaunt it &#150; but think Katy Perry more than Katie Price.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Get confident</strong><br />The secret to looking good, essentially, is confidence &#150; if you&#146;re all hunched over in the latest trend, you&#146;re not going to be getting papped, but if you strike a pose in whatever makes you FEEL awesome, you&#146;ll find yourself looking great as well. Work out what you&#146;re comfortable in and stick to it; there&#146;s no point stepping out in a top hat if you&#146;re not wearing it with the utmost conviction!</p>\n<p><a title=\"The top 10 confidence tips you need to know\" href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/the-ten-confidence-tips-you-need-to_know?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">THE TOP 10 CONFIDENCE TIPS YOU NEED TO KNOW</a></p>\n<p>So, make like Nicki Minaj and work out what you want your look to do for you; her cotton-candy style and sugar-sweet makeup help forge a fantastic contrast with her fierce feminist lyrics.

From the verdict against Tyler Clementi's roommate to the recent documentary <a href=\"http://thebullyproject.com/\"target=\"_blank\"><em>Bully</em></a>, it seems like what has long been kept in the dark is finally being brought to light. That&#146;s brought up some bad memories for me, since I was bullied. I have friends who went to see the documentary, but I couldn't bear to watch it. It's still too painful. Without going into all the awful details&#151;kids used to hawk loogies into my hair and empty their lunch trays in my bag&#151;suffice it to say&#160;the shame, pain, and grief from being bullied have stuck with me well into adulthood.<br /><br />Thankfully it's not something I've had to think about much since graduating high school. That is, until my own kids have started approaching the age at which I was tormented. When my first grader came home from school with a bloody nose and scratched face, I completely lost it. My reaction probably scared him more than the original incident had. Suddenly I envisioned for him a future in school like the one I had growing up, and I was desperate to do anything to save him from that. <em>Desperation.</em>&#160;That's a feeling I know too well.<br /><br />But today, it's different. School administrators, while not as helpful as I personally would have hoped, were light years better than the teachers who ignored my incidents. Other parents were supportive. The teachers were caring. All of this made me realize that the cure for bullying is bringing it out into the open. Talking about it; acting on it; anything besides ignoring it.<br /><br />My kids are already much smarter, cooler, more interesting people than I was, but what gives me even more hope for the future is that bullying and being bullied are part of the public conversation now. This is why I am so excited that <em>REDBOOK</em> is continuing the conversation with this new video on bullying.<br /><br /> What was your experience in school like? Do you think bullying is handled better these days?<br /></p>\n&#160;<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n</div>\n\n<!--\nBy use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C\nfound at http://corp.brightcove.com/legal/terms_publisher.cfm.\n-->\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\"></script>\n\n<object id=\"myExperience\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\">\n<param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n<param name=\"width\" value=\"606\" />\n<param name=\"height\" value=\"344\" />\n<param name=\"playerID\" value=\"75704700001\" />\n<param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAAAPa7mtE~,bWW6_mqrT7qyuZKfaNgNM538t4pu153T\" />\n<param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"optimizedContentLoad\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" />\n<param name=\"@videoList\" value=\"1640830837001\" />\n<param name=\"@videoList.featured\" value=\"1642699823001\" />\n</object>\n<!--\nThis script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon\nas the line is read by the browser.

The regulations were slated to go into effect on June 18, 2012 (with smaller companies given a year's leeway to make the changes). Those are the changes described in this article. But on May 11, 2012, after the June edition of <i>Good Housekeeping</i> had been printed and mailed, the FDA decided to allow manufacturers an additional six months &#151; to December 18 &#151; to upgrade their labels. So while you'll see many products with the new info, there may still be old ones on shelves, too. Our advice: For outdoor use, look for a lotion with an SPF of at least 30, that also protects against UVA light, and even if it says \"waterproof,\" reapply every two hours.</b></p>\n\n<br />\n<p>Once upon a time (last year), picking the right bottle of sunscreen was more like a guessing game than an informed consumer choice: Did you need an SPF of 100+, or would 15 suffice? Generic or brand-name? Would a $5 product cut it, or did you have to spend five times that much? And just what <i>were</i> those unpronounceable ingredients? This year, you no longer have to wonder: New FDA-mandated labels are required on almost all sunscreens by June 18. \"The packages will be more about test results and less about marketing,\" says an enthusiastic Theresa Pacheco, M.D., associate professor of dermatology at the University of Colorado.

Sadly, most of us don&#146;t have his constitution. So to steel your body for a long life of indulgence, nutritionist Drew Price has cooked up a breakfast that will give you Keith&#146;s staying power by strengthening your immunity and liver (brown sugar not included). </p>\n<p>First, switch your morning toast for a rye bagel: scientists at Sweden&#146;s Lund University found this helps control your blood sugar. Fill it with the ingredients below and both your energy levels and life span will increase, not fade away.</p>\n\n<h2>Lengthen your lifespan </h2>\n<p><strong>Baby spinach, 1 large handful </strong>\n<br />In addition to disease-fighting folate and vitamin E, Popeye&#146;s favourite increases your body&#146;s coenzyme Q10 levels. Think of this as the essential bass-line to your longevity. Research from the Linus Pauling Institute says that Q10 supports the mitochondria (energy powerhouses that keep every cell inside you functioning) and slows the ageing process.</p> \n\n<h2>Offset excess </h2>\n<p><strong>Salsa verde, 2 tbsp </strong>\n<br />The combination of herbs in the dressing provides a variety of useful micronutrients, but the frontman here is the olive-oil base. It helps reverse some of the factors that can lead to liver disease, according to research published in the journal <em>Gastroenterology</em>, and also aids the body&#146;s reaction to fatty or carb-heavy meals. </p>\n\n<h2>Neutralise junk habits </h2>\n<p><strong>2 eggs, boiled and sliced </strong>\n<br />Eggs are the support team, the talented session nutrients. They&#146;re a good source of the trace metal selenium: this antioxidant protects the hard working cells of your liver and, according to research in the journal <em>Nutrition</em>, helps to dispose of trans fats &#150; the kind you pick up at 3am, when the only place that&#146;s open is called Kebab-u-like. </p>\n\n<h2>Shine a light on your immunity </h2>\n<p><strong>1 red pepper, sliced </strong>\n<br />This is the vitamin C solo. Levels of the compound fall when your body is overworked with stress or toxic excess. But vitamin C deserves its time in the spotlight because it supports several immune functions. Peppers are one of the best sources: a cupful contains twice the vitamin C of an orange. </p>\n\n<h2>Bolster your toxic defences </h2>\n<p><strong>Smoked salmon, 70g </strong>\n<br />Think of this as vice insurance. Astaxanthin, the compound that gives salmon its pink colour, stimulates the enzymes that your liver uses to clear toxins from the body. A <em>British Journal of Nutrition</em> study found it produced a 55-fold increase in their levels. Pack all these ingredients into your bagel to develop resilience that Keef would be proud of.</p>\n\n<p><br /><em><font size=\"1\">Photography: Dan Matthews<br />Food styling: Maud Eden</font></em></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"1\">Follow <em>MH</em> on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/menshealthuk\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/facebook\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></font></p>\n","article_type_name":"Open Format Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-05-16T06:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11521","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-tjoyce","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"open_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"7795373","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/food-nutrition/life-extending-superfood-sandwich\">Life-extending superfood sandwich </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/five-essential-superfood-combinations\">Five essential superfood combinations</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/cook-1-for-5-pork\">Cook once to eat all week: Pork</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/a-supercharged-salad\">MH ultimate superfood salad</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/healthier-steak\">Make steak safer with spinach </a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/spicy-spinach-and-lentil-soup-with-sardine-toasts\">Spicy spinach and lentil soup with sardine toasts</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/curry-spiced-salmon-with-spinach-and-chickpeas\">Curry-spiced salmon with spinach and chickpeas</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/smoked-haddock-spinach-chowder-224818\">Smoked haddock and spinach chowder</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/the-best-sandwiches-you-can-make-338168\">The best sandwiches you can make</a><br>\n<a href=\"/food-nutrition/the-30g-protein-sandwich\">The 30g protein sandwich </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":"May '12 p47","print_issue_date":"2012-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1089","last_updated_date":"2013-01-08T12:05:43.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-04-02T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/healthy-recipes/life-extending-superfood-sandwich","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"House Beautiful's brilliant buy of the moment","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"bargain buys for your home, house beautiful, home buys on a budget, vase","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Savvy shopper: lace looks","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-04-26T10:46:59.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"639","teaser":"House Beautiful's brilliant buy of the moment","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"House Beautiful's brilliant buy of the moment","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"allaboutyou.com brings you House Beautiful's best ideas for your home including this inexpensive embossed vase. allaboutyou.com &#150;

I could not take my eyes off him, stumbling through an interview with some unwitting professor. Boldness or naivete, a tinge of courage. Something worked about this kid using television itself to mock people who clearly felt they ought to be on television. I asked a British friend, \"What's with the kid with the tracksuit?\" \"Oh, that's Ali G. It's a put-on.\" He explained Baron Cohen's background, son of a London businessman, and his charade as a hip-hop beat reporter. \"Quite good at first. But the jig's up a bit, don't you think?\" </p><p>Three years later, on a subway platform in New York, I saw an early promotional poster for HBO's <i>Da Ali G</i><i>Show</i> and thought, <i>Well, there goes that. People will sniff this out in a week.</i> With popularity, Baron Cohen would lose anonymity for Ali G. Jig's up, I figured. Just like the UK.</p><p>This is the confounding problem of SBC: He shouldn't last. He can't last, not once he's been discovered. And yet he does. Before that, when no one knew his game, he was free to unscroll Ali G and the early version of Borat as performance pieces that revealed the stunning arrogance of interview subjects greedily stumbling in front of television cameras. Sam Donaldson, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Naomi Wolf, Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich. And for two of the show's three seasons, Baron Cohen pulled it off beautifully &#151; knocking off interviews with politicians and academics in which Ali G, Borat, or Br&#252;no agitated, confused, and riled the sensibilities of the powerful simply by offering up a microphone, improvising within the skin of his various characters. I loved it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/cm/esquire/images/fw/esq-cohen-evolution-0512-lg.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>But every day that Ali G existed in the HBO watercooler zeitgeist was just one less day Ali G could exist at all. Same with Borat, same with Br&#252;no, when they hit the big screen. Yes, Baron Cohen raised the stakes slightly, placing himself in socially or politically dangerous positions while in the guise of character. But soon, people knew. The discovery clock ticked onward. And when everybody was in on the joke, the joke got a whole lot uglier. Once American public figures were on to him (remember, please, that Ron Paul was among <i>the last</i>) and the force of his setups &#151; designed to reveal callowness, cruelty, racism, sexism, blind anger: righteous stuff when slipping from the lips of pious turds like James Baker or Brent Scowcroft &#151; they turned themselves on an unsuspecting, and sometimes undeserving, public. </p><p>The ugliness that Baron Cohen gleaned &#151; the xenophobia he mustered from those who met Borat, or the legendary though hardly surprising moments of homophobia revealed in Br&#252;no &#151; seemed timely, and potent. They hardly seemed legendary in retrospect &#151; more like moments purposefully induced, planned, hunted down for effect. The larger and more comic the Disneyesque head of his characters became, the more social insight was replaced by social stunt. I think dumber film critics call this a kind of evolution or growth. But the jig's up once again. We lose him before we really got to have him. The more people recognize him, the bigger his act is forced to be, and the less he can do (that which he did best in the earliest moments of Ali G) &#151; show a little vulnerability, a little heart, and a lot less cunning. </p><p>Only now, with <i>The Dictator,</i> is Baron Cohen clearly stunt-starved, aiming his work smack-dab into the solar plexus of American preconceptions about the Middle East. Dumping ashes <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/ryan-seacrest-sacha-baron-cohen-ash-022712\">on Seacrest</a>. Sure, there's something brave in that. Yes, Arabs need to learn to laugh at themselves as well as we do. True, SBC is a Jew. Assemble your own semiphilosophical junior-college communication-class wisdom from those very facts. But note, too, that from the very moment <i>The Dictator</i>'s trailer <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/the-dictator-trailer-7675159\">appeared</a> with its litany of lousy bits &#151; fixing the footrace, buying American actresses for sex, the trite fascination with America itself, all of it reconstituted from the DNA of cheap banana-dictator films &#151; it has been clear that Sacha Baron Cohen is on-script now. Once it was fun to be in on his secret, to give a night of movie watching over to seeing how far Sacha Baron Cohen might go. There was a time you never wanted the power of his satiric insight to go broadly public.

But these fights don&#146;t have to scare or scar your little ones. In fact, some fights can be invaluable teaching tools. Read on for nine things to keep in mind when arguments break out, from which topics are and aren&#146;t okay for tiny ears to hear to how to ensure your children learn from your disagreements.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Fight fair.</strong></p>\n<p>This means no name-calling, no screaming and no threats. &#147;Focus on the content of the fight,&#148; suggests Tina B. Tessina, PhD, psychotherapist and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Money-Sex-Kids-Fighting-Marriage/dp/B001QCX4M2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1334002859&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Money, Sex and Kids: Stop Fighting about the Three Things That Can Ruin Your Marriage</em></a>. &#147;No-holds-barred arguing forces kids to take on responsibility that doesn't belong to them&#151;to keep you two from fighting.&#160;It sets a bad example of what marriage is and may affect their ability to keep relationships going.&#148; According to Michael Osit, EdD, a clinical psychologist who works with families, it&#146;s important that your children don&#146;t see out-of-control rage. &#147;They should understand that parents can get mad at each other and still love each other,&#148; he says.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Avoid adult topics.</strong></p>\n<p>Many conversations are fine to have in front of children. Certain subjects, though, should be off-limits. An obvious one: your sex life, says Dr. Tessina. A not-so-apparent one: If you&#146;re annoyed that your husband drank too much after a night out with his buddies, speak about that privately. &#147;The kids shouldn&#146;t know one of you has a hangover. They don&#146;t know how to interpret adult things, so don&#146;t expose them to something they&#146;re not ready to understand,&#148; says Dr. Tessina. And you shouldn&#146;t talk badly about other family members, immediate or extended. &#147;Discussions about particular people, like your mother-in-law, might get repeated to that person. Or the kids might start reacting oddly to that person,&#148; she warns.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Never argue about decisions concerning the kids.</strong></p>\n<p>You may occasionally disagree over rules for your children, but work that out behind closed doors. Otherwise, &#147;the parent who isn&#146;t siding with the child could seem like the bad guy. And that can make him or her a less effective parent because their authority is being circumvented,&#148; says Dr. Osit. But there&#146;s a bigger issue: When children see they can divide and conquer their parents, they may get an inflated idea of their role. &#147;If they start expecting to get what they want all the time, then they don&#146;t know their place as a child. They&#146;ll think they have authority in other areas of the family,&#148; explains Dr. Osit.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Solve a problem before it escalates.</strong></p>\n<p>Disagreements happen, but there&#146;s always a way to avoid fighting, according to Robert Epstein, PhD, research psychologist, former editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Psychology Today</em></a> and founder of <a href=\"http://MyParentingSkills.com\" target=\"_blank\">MyParentingSkills.com</a>. &#147;Any conflict can be resolved peacefully and constructively.&#148; For example, if you and your spouse are arguing about who should do the dishes, Dr. Espstein recommends discussing who did the dishes last time or who cooked dinner. Worst case scenario? Flip a coin. &#147;That way, your child is cheering. You&#146;re resolving things positively,&#148; he says.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Make sure they hear you resolve the conflict.</strong></p>\n<p>While Dr. Osit recommends avoiding ongoing fights in front of the kids, hashing out disagreements that are quickly solvable can benefit them. &#147;It&#146;s good for children to hear that your opinions differ on, say, what TV show to watch or where to go out for dinner,&#148; he says. These are opportunities to model how you&#146;d want your kids to fight: with a goal of reaching a compromise, not winning. &#147;They can learn to negotiate by observing you,&#148; says Dr. Tessina. &#147;They also learn to problem-solve, listen to things they may not agree with, consider each other's wants and needs and stick with a discussion until a solution is reached,&#148; says Dr. Tessina. Through conflict&#151;and conflict resolution&#151;you&#146;re teaching them how to manage their own lives with classmates at school, siblings at home and eventually, colleagues at work.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Follow up separately afterwards. </strong></p>\n<p>If you and your partner have a big blowout in front of the kids, check in with them later to let them know everything&#146;s okay. &#147;First tell them, &#145;I&#146;m sorry we argued in front of you. We shouldn&#146;t have done that,&#146;&#148; recommends Dr. Osit. And it&#146;s worse if you and your husband sit down with your children at the same time. &#147;That may be too formal, so let them know separately and casually that the issue&#146;s been resolved.&#148; This is crucial because your child&#146;s angst over conflict at home could lead to conflicts outside of it. &#147;Kids tend to replay family issues through other relationships. They could transfer parental conflicts onto their siblings, peers and teachers,&#148; says Dr. Osit. &#147;Or they can act out or become depressed.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>7. Never make them take sides.</strong></p>\n<p>Not only do you want to avoid arguing about your kids in front of them, but you should never ask them to choose which parent they agree with, even on the smallest matters. &#147;Don&#146;t ask them to vote for one parent over the other,&#148; says Linda Nielsen, EdD, educational and adolescent psychologist at Wake Forest University and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Between-Fathers-Daughters-Rebuilding-Relationship/dp/1581826613\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Between Fathers and Daughters</em></a>. &#147;They can sit there and observe, but what does damage, even if the issue itself is trivial, is putting kids in the middle.&#148; If they get to settle an argument by siding with a parent, it can give them a false sense of power over the family. Plus, they can feel guilty about picking one parent over the other. &#147;It&#146;s worse than arguing over something important in their presence.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>8. Blow off steam together after a fight.</strong></p>\n<p>Losing your cool or being impatient or irrational with someone you love is a result of stress. &#147;If we lose control, we&#146;re stressed, and we&#146;re probably stressed for a few minutes after a fight&#151;and so are our children,&#148; says Dr. Epstein. &#147;So find a way to help yourself and your children manage that stress.&#148; Dr. Epstein has taught his six-year-old daughter breathing techniques. &#147;She &#145;blows things.&#146; It&#146;s Lamaze-type breathing. If we think she needs more, we&#146;ll say, &#145;Blow our heads off!&#146; She&#146;ll blow as hard as she can, we&#146;ll throw our heads back and she&#146;ll start to laugh,&#148; he says. &#147;Bottom line: Some things go wrong and sometimes we don&#146;t feel good, but there are ways to make ourselves feel better.&#148; Other suggestions: Go for a walk or swim or hit up the dollar store for good, cheap fun. These can help you move past the fight, says Dr. Epstein.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Don&#146;t try to be perfect.</strong></p>\n<p>If you give your children the impression that their family is conflict-free, then they won&#146;t be prepared to handle conflict in the outside world. According to Dr. Nielsen, some cultures don&#146;t really engage in verbal arguments. But kids from cultures where there is some arguing tend to be less stressed about it in life because they know it&#146;s not the end of the world. &#147;Some families hurt their kids&#146; immune systems by over-cleaning. Shielding them from fights does a similar thing,&#148; says Dr. Nielsen. &#147;You&#146;ve got to sling a little dirt sometimes and let them build up immunity to that.&#148; So as long as you play by the rules, fighting in front of your children can give them the tools they need to cope with conflict in healthy ways.&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-15T13:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"977133","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/uH/parents-fighting-child-teddy-bear-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Gekas","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8048780","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":null,"allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-05-15T20:52:56.000Z","author_id":"11889","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-04-12T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/sex-relationships/family/arguing-in-front-of-children","issue_date":"WomansDay.com","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"It's no secret that this star is stunning.

She smiles, as every mother does when reminiscing about her children as babies, but her eyes also mist over while she revisits the early life of her twin daughters. She runs a finger down the milestones she documented: Addison's first words were \"outside\" and \"open\"; Cassidy's were \"doggie\" and \"duckie.\" They walked early, at 10 months. The photos are adorable &#151; naked babies blowing bubbles and smearing vanilla frosting all over their faces, bright-eyed toddlers hell-bent on climbing over furniture, mischievous little girls unleashing flash floods at the water cooler. \"They just got into stuff,\" Chris says, laughing. \"They were super -happy, smiling all the time.\"</p>\n<p>Her gaze moves to her daughters, 7 at the time of this visit, slumped at a toddler table, their eyes unfocused and distant. Chris sits down to feed them, lifting the spoon with encouraging coos that are met with an occasional grunt, but mostly silence. Tiny pieces of turkey and pineapple miss the girls' mouths and land in the hard plastic bibs circling their necks. Cassi flails her hands about, refusing to eat. She can barely keep her head steady.</p>\n<p>After lunch, Chris's husband, Hugh &#151; a no-nonsense bear of a man whose serious disposition melts around his daughters &#151; carries Addi and Cassi to a room down the hall, where they sit on miniature overstuffed chairs covered in white sheets and watch cartoons most of the day. Chris returns to the album and pages back to images of the girls on tricycles at age 3. \"We noticed they weren't pedaling right,\" she says. At first, the signs of trouble were vague: The twins didn't seem to be running like other kids, or they'd walk and suddenly their heads would flop backward. Then they came down with a virus. In Chris's view, there was an instant change. \"Their eyes were just delirious,\" she says. It was right around their third birthday, and they couldn't shake their sickness.</p>\n<p>As the weeks bled into months, Chris knew something was seriously wrong: \"I could see these subtle things &#151; like their balance was off. And their eyes didn't seem to be tracking right. Other people thought I was crazy,\" she says. \"My family kept telling me the girls were fine.\"</p>\n<p>Then, during an exam, the girls' pediatrician found that their spleens were swollen to four times the normal size. Chris took them straight to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, CA. Over the course of five visits, they were seen by top immunologists, geneticists, and hematologists, none of whom could figure out what was wrong with Chris's daughters.</p>\n<p>That would take another 18 months.</p>\n<p>Although all the tests came back negative, Chris was sure the girls &#151; who were, after all, identical twins &#151; had a genetic condition. Then she noticed troubling new neurological symptoms, especially a faint slippage into slurred speech, and e-mailed the geneticist at Stanford &#151; who realized there was one disease he hadn't tested for.</p>\n<p>It was an extremely rare genetic disorder called Niemann-Pick Type C disease (NPC), which affects only about 250 children in the U.S. Chris immediately Googled it and was devastated. NPC, she read, was a defect on the gene that regulates cholesterol metabolism in the cells. Harmful amounts of the fatty lipid (which our bodies make continuously and normally excrete) accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and, ultimately, brain, leading to neurological deterioration that can trigger seizures and loss of motor skills like walking, holding a pencil, even swallowing. NPC is sometimes dubbed \"childhood Alzheimer's\" because it leads to severe dementia.</p>\n<p>Chris had the girls' skin biopsies rushed to Stanford. Two weeks later, on October 17, 2007, the hospital called and confirmed her worst fear: Her daughters had NPC. As they watched, Chris ran out of the house, crying hysterically. <em>How can this be?</em> she thought. <em>They're talking and singing and playing with the neighbor's dog and having fun at school. And now they're going to lose their minds and die?</em></p>\n<p>\"We're sorry,\" the doctors told her. \"There's nothing anyone can do.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong> Next: <a

Unfortunately, when you're feeling blue, it can be hard to muster up the physical and mental energy needed to do the things that will make you happier. Planning a brunch party, weeding the garden, or pulling out a craft project seems like a lot of trouble, while plunking down in front of the TV or digging into a tub of ice cream entices you as an easy fix. But research shows (and you know it's true) that these aren't the routes to lifting your spirits.</p>\n<p>Instead, I've found it helpful to look for patterns in the times of day when I begin to drag: Am I having trouble getting out of bed in the morning? Passing out at my desk in the mid-afternoon? Dragging around the apartment after dinner instead of having fun with my family? Sometimes, oddly, I'm too tired to go to bed: I can't face the effort of brushing my teeth, washing my face, and all the rest. Once I identified the energy dips in my daily routine, I was able to identify strategies to keep my energy higher &#151; and I've been astonished by how quickly and easily I'm able to give myself a boost.</p>\n<p>For long-term energy, it's most important to a) get enough sleep and b) get some exercise. But that doesn't help you if you need some energy <em>right now. </em>When I'm desperate for an immediate happiness boost, these are the tips that really work for me:</p>\n<p><strong>1. GO OUTSIDE INTO THE SUNLIGHT</strong> Light deprivation is one reason that people feel tired. Research suggests that light stimulates brain chemicals that improve mood. For an extra boost, get your sunlight first thing in the morning. And while you're outside...</p>\n<p><strong>2. GO FOR A BRISK WALK </strong>One study found that even a 10-minute walk is enough to increase energy and decrease tension.</p>\n<p><strong>3. ACT WITH ENERGY</strong> We think we act because of the way we feel, but often we feel because of the way we act. Trick yourself into feeling energetic by moving more quickly, pacing while you talk on the phone, and putting more energy into your voice.</p>\n<p><strong>4. LISTEN TO YOUR FAVORITE UPBEAT SONG</strong> Hearing stimulating music gives an instant lift and is one of the quickest, most reliable ways to affect your mood and energy level. I'm always surprised by the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>5. TALK TO AN ENERGETIC FRIEND</strong> Not only do you gain energy from interacting with other people, but you also &#151; in what's called emotional contagion &#151; \"catch\" their emotions. Instead of infecting others with your draggy mood, try to lift yourself by catching the energy of a boisterous friend.</p>\n<p><strong>6. TACKLE AN ITEM ON YOUR TO-DO LIST</strong> Unfinished tasks weigh you down. So if you feel bad about skipping your skin cancer check, not having completed an overdue report, or not having faced this month's bills, force yourself to tackle one thing that's nagging at you. It's tough, but you will feel a <em>huge</em> rush of energy when you cross it off your list.</p>\n<p><strong>7. CLEAN UP</strong> I'm not sure why tidying makes such a huge difference, but when I feel like I can't face the day, I tidy up my desk, and I perk right up.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong> Next: <a href=\"/health/wellness/energy-boosting-tips\"> Learn more of Gretchen Rubin's mood boosting tips</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-15T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"988507","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/vJ/gretchen-rubin-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Rubin","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":"about-gretchen-rubin","parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372727","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health/keys-to-happiness\">Built-In Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/wellness/tips-for-increasing-happiness\">The How of Happiness </a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/happy-at-any-age\">Three Celebs Reveal the Secret to Happiness &mdash;

And although the two conditions are sometimes confused, the treatments for them are very different, as I learned when I took a closer look at clearing up my own legs.</p>\n<br />\n<h3>Spider Veins</h3><p><b>WHAT THEY ARE:</b> Small blood vessels near the surface of the skin that are dilated and therefore visible. They can show up as a single thread or as a cluster, like a spiderweb (hence the name). Fortunately, they aren't essential for circulation.</p><p><b>THE TRIGGER:</b> Heredity is the primary cause, though women are more susceptible to spider veins than men are. \"It's not completely understood why, but hormones may weaken the vessels during puberty and pregnancy,\" says Dr. Rockman. Hot baths are not likely culprits, she says: \"Vessels close to the skin dilate in heat, but the effect is temporary.\" Sitting or standing for too long can exacerbate them, though. </p><p><b>THE TREATMENT:</b> Sclerotherapy, a decades-old procedure, is still the gold standard, says Kenneth Mark, M.D., a New York City dermatologist. A solution is injected into the vein, causing it to collapse and be absorbed by the body. The good news: The latest solution doesn't burn like the old saline. Since I'd had broken capillaries on my face zapped away, I asked about lasers for spider veins. \"They're less effective for treating larger veins and more painful,\" Dr. Mark says. And they generally can't be used on patients with dark skin. However, lasers work for vessels too tiny for injections &#151; or for the truly needle-phobic. </p><p><b>MY CASE:</b> Not being afraid of needles, and having lived through several summers with scattered squiggles on my legs, I opted for sclerotherapy.  Dr. Mark and I identified the most obvious spots to treat on both legs, four altogether: my inside ankle, back of knee, back of calf, inner thigh. I felt a mild cramping with the biggest vein, but for the others just a fleeting pinch. </p><p><b>POST-PROCEDURE CARE:</b> To heal, I wore thigh-high, medical-grade (16 to 20 mm HG) compression stockings made by Mediven for a solid week, day and night, except while showering. The pressure helps keep blood out of the veins so they disappear faster. I had bruising &#151; not uncommon &#151; and one tiny hard-to-heal spot at the injection site behind my knee. Dr. Mark also urged me to avoid the sun for three weeks and minimize exposure for three months after treatment, since UV light increases the odds of skin darkening.</p><p><b>RESULTS:</b> It can take weeks for the wall of the vein to completely collapse, which is why treatments are spaced three to four weeks apart. Veins may darken before they disappear, or they may need to be re-treated. I had to have one stubborn area redone (the veins were still visible). It was two months before I could appreciate the results, but at that point my legs looked much better. Of course, with the constant inspection, I couldn't help but notice other little squiggles. That's the nature of spiders: You can't prevent new ones from cropping up.</p><p><b>COST:</b> While the injections are relatively painless, the price may sting. Because spider veins are a cosmetic concern, the treatment isn't covered by insurance. A single session ranges from $200 to $1,000, depending on your geographic location and how many areas are being treated. (For example, a $250 syringe &#151; the cost at Dr. Mark's &#151; only treats one or two clusters.)</p><br />\n<p><b>Next: <a href=\"/beauty/anti-aging/varicose-spider-veins-treatment-2\">Treatment for varicose veins</a></b></p>\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-15T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"991527","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/cT/0612-leg-lift-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Myers","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372724","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/beauty/varicose-spider-veins-treatment\">Give Your Legs a Lift</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/leg-exercise-jun07\">The Only Leg Exercise You Need</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/fitness/fitness-plan-two-weeks-oct06\">Lose 2 Inches in 2 Weeks</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/fashion/wide-leg-pants\">How to Wear Wide-Leg Pants</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/appliance-problem-fixes\">Quick Fixes for Common Appliance Problems </a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/fitness/drop-dress-size-six-weeks-strength-training\">Drop a Dress Size in 6 Weeks</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/fitness/muscle-toning-walking\">Tone Up in 20 Minutes: Walking and Strength Exercises</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/home-products/top-window-treatments\">10 Top Window Treatment Trends</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/dress-to-look-younger\">Drop-a-Decade in Style</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/farouk-royal-treatment-by-chi-gold-ceramic-digital-hair-dryer\">Farouk Royal Treatment by CHI Gold Ceramic Digital Hair Dryer</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:40:06.000Z","author_id":"11646","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2028-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/anti-aging/varicose-spider-veins-treatment","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Want to try the grilling recipes from June's Weeknight Meals?

Get the nutritional low down on some waistline-friendly choices in this at-a-glance guide.</p>\n<h3>Caf&#233; Rouge</h3>\n<p><strong>Eat Boeuf Bourguignon, 749 calories, not <strong>Salade</strong> Paysanne, 1,101 calories</strong></p>\n<p>This salad may look innocent, but the combination of chicken, bacon, avocado and egg bumps up its calorie content. The lemon and garlic dressing probably has a lot to answer for, too.<strong><br />Need to know</strong><br />Caf&#233; Rouge offers a range of dishes under 600 calories, which are highlighted with a symbol on the menu. Or go vegetarian for another guilt-free option. Visit <a href=\"http://www.caferouge.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">www.caferouge.co.uk</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Pizza Express</h3>\n<p><strong>Eat La Reine pizza, 717 calories, not Giardiniera pizza, 925 calories</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the toppings are healthy, but there are just a few too many&#133; Pesto and garlic oil in the base sauce add to the fat content, too.<strong><br />Need to know</strong><br />Avoid anything on the menu with extra bread and if you&#146;d prefer your pizza made with less mozzarella or fewer fatty meats, ask your waiter. For a reliable healthy option, the Leggera section of the menu features pizzas under 500 calories. Visit <a href=\"http://www.pizzaexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.pizzaexpress.com</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Nando&#146;s</h3>\n<p><strong>Eat Half a chicken and Corn on the cob, 453 calories, not 10 Chicken wings and Coleslaw, 857 calories</strong></p>\n<p>With an incredible 400 extra calories and more than twice the fat of half a chicken, these wings are a definite miss.<strong><br />Need to know</strong><br />Tempting special deals can encourage you to eat more than you need, as two side dishes are often included. Resist and order just one main and one regular side, and you&#146;ll save money as well as calories. Visit <a href=\"http://www.nandos.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">www.nandos.co.uk</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Prezzo</h3>\n<p><strong>Eat Pollo Siciliana & Gratinated Potatoes, 498 calories, not Crab Cakes & Courgette Fries, &#160;1,265 calories</strong></p>\n<p>Who would think a low-fat fish and a low-carb side wasn&#146;t healthy? But it&#146;s all deep fried &#150; hence the disappointingly high calorie count.<strong><br />Need to know</strong><br />There is a dedicated Light Options section of the menu, but the salads are all under 600 calories too, as are three of the grilled chicken dishes. Do be careful, though, when choosing side dishes. Visit <a href=\"http://www.prezzorestaurants.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">www.prezzorestaurants.co.uk </a>for more information.</p>\n<h3>Strada</h3>\n<p><strong>Eat Spaghetti Ragu, 635 calories, not Rigatoni Speck, 1,113 calories</strong></p>\n<p>It&#146;s dishes like this that give pasta a bad dieting name. But here the calories and saturated fat are in the sauce, which is made of cream with two types of cheese.<strong><br />Need to know</strong><br />Skip the Pane (bread) section &#150; sharing a Cesto di Pane Misto with a friend means 500 calories apiece! Dishes under 600 calories are marked, and two of the fish dishes are under 500.

Here's why it works: \"Every sales manager is compensated based on how much his agents sell.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2 Price it right.</strong>&#160;\"Listing too high is the biggest mistake sellers make,\" says Marie Otis, a real estate agent with CBSHOME Real Estate in Omaha, NE. \"It drives me crazy when people say, 'Can't we list at a higher price for the first few weeks to see if we get any action?' Buyers won't waste time looking at an overpriced home. So when your agent suggests a price range based on comparable sales, go with the lower end of the range,\" says Otis. Don't chase the market or else you'll end up selling for a lot less than you could have.</p>\n<p><strong>3 Once you finish decluttering, do it again.&#160;</strong>\"Sellers usually think they've put away a lot, but most of the time they haven't,\" says Barb Schwarz, CEO of&#160;<a href=\"http://www.stagedhomes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StagedHomes.com</a>&#160;and author of&#160;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Staging-Sell-Secret-Selling-Market/dp/0470447125\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Staging to Sell</em></a>. \"When I get to the house, I always find more things that need to be packed up, like family photos, books stacked on tables, too many throw pillows on the sofa, too much artwork on the walls. Keep it to no more than three of each. You want potential buyers to mentally move in, and they can't do that if they're focused on your stuff.\"</p>\n<p><strong>4 Follow the four-month rule.</strong>&#160;When a home sits unsold for months, buyers think,<em>&#160;I bet we can get it for a song,</em>&#160;says Otis. Translation: lowball offers. \"If your house has been on the market for more than four months, take it off and relist two months later,\" says Corcoran. \"That way, when it goes back on sale it looks brand-new to buyers, especially those who have just started house hunting. The truth is, few people take the time to search the history of a house.\"</p>\n<p><strong>5 Hire a cleaning crew.</strong>&#160;A spruce-up isn't enough. You need to have your home deep-cleaned by professionals, says Otis. \"It's worth the investment, because buyers will decide if a house is their dream home in about 15 seconds,\" she says. \"And nothing turns them off like dirt.\"</p>\n<p><strong>6 Do a smell check.</strong>&#160;\"Bad odors make people turn right around and walk out,\" cautions Schwarz.<em>&#160;</em>\"You live with those smells, so you probably don't even notice them.\" Ask a friend for an honest assessment, especially if you smoke, have pets or often cook pungent foods. If it's not good news, that's another reason to get your home professionally cleaned. \"A fresh, clean smell is what you want,\" says Otis. \"Some people bake cookies or boil cinnamon to make their home smell nice. But keep in mind, a prospective buyer may not like those scents.\"</p>\n<p><strong>7 Make a price drop count.&#160;</strong>\"When a house isn't selling, many people lower the price inch by inch,\" says Corcoran. A better strategy: Reduce once by a big chunk&#151;$25,000 to $50,000 or more. \"Buyers shop by price brackets and this puts your home into a different one, attracting new buyers.\" Go just below a cap, say $249,000 instead of $250,000. \"Psychologically, it makes a difference to buyers.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-14T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"980343","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/Sa/real-estate-agent-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Day Staff","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mmajor","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8210330","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-05-14T15:18:38.000Z","author_id":"11945","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-04-19T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/life/saving-money/how-to-sell-your-house","issue_date":"Woman's Day; May 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Perfect your posture by giving your spine&#146;s surrounding muscles a strength boost","site_id":"583","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"15-minute back workout","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2013-01-25T09:44:41.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"unknown","source_id":"641","teaser":"Perfect your posture by giving your spine&#146;s surrounding muscles a strength boost","origin_site_id":"583","sub_heading":"Perfect your posture by giving your spine&#146;s surrounding muscles a strength boost.

And obviously, that busy life may preclude you from snatching a couple of days to spend solely on pampering yourself. So if you're pushed for time or strapped for cash, why not treat yourself to a facial?</p>\n<p>My skin was feeling neglected: early starts mean my morning skincare routine is skimped on; I'm out in all weathers cycling every day from station to office, and that office suffers from an extremely dry atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Spa InterContinental is on the first floor of the InterContinental hotel on Park Lane. I say Park Lane because that's where you'll notice the building: right at the southern end of the street, just across the way from the Wellington Arch. However, the entrance is round the back of the building, in Hamilton Place.</p>\n<p>Arriving a little early, I'm ushered to a soft armchair and treated to a little plate of nibbles (blueberries, pecans and dried banana) with my peppermint tea. The dark wood on the walls, with orchids dotted around, together with the subdued lighting and the not-too-intrusive soundtrack of ambient music makes the outside world feel very far away.</p>\n<p>My therapist, Melissa, takes me to the treatment room, showing me the little wardrobe area for my clothes and telling me I can leave my bra on but to slip the straps down. Once on the treatment couch I'm mesmerised by the egg-shaped lighting panel, with an aura of ever-changing coloured light.</p>\n<p>As she cleanses my face and prepares my skin for the treatment, Melissa tells me that the Elemis anti-ageing facial is one of the spa's most popular, even though it's one of the most recently introduced.</p>\n<p>After I'm washed, cleansed and toned, with accompanying wafts of rose and herbs, a tri-enzyme serum is applied, followed by a gel mask to allow it to soak in. The mask is deliciously cool and moist, with a fresh menthol-pine smell. I'm now wearing a weighted eye mask, which is strangely relaxing. The mild tingling sensation from the mask (perfectly normal) starts soon after application and I take this as a good sign. If I can feel it, it must be doing something...</p>\n<p>And independent testing shows that this facial does indeed do something. Just one treatment is proven to visibly resurface the skin by up to 75%, and increase smoothness by up to 32%. The trio of enzymes - subtilisine, protease and papain - stimulate cell renewal and promote smoother, clearer, younger-looking skin. Among the other active ingredients are white truffle extract, which supports the skin's microflora, creating the perfect environment for the enzymes to do their work.</p>\n<p>Melissa covers me with a warm quilt, and sets to work on the shoulder, neck and head massage. She works deftly and fluidly, not the easiest of manoeuvres when the person you're massaging is lying on her back. When she starts working on my scalp, my mind really starts to spin free... I'm just starting to drift off when it's time for the mask to be peeled off. It comes away easily, in one piece, with none of the tugging at the skin you get when a mask has adhered over-enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>After a final tidy-up, Melissa raises the head end of the couch - which is great because I'm so relaxed I don't think I could have done it unaided! She invited me to feel my skin - wow! I've never felt it so smoth.</p>\n<p>Back at work my colleagues agree that my skin does look smoother, brighter and fresher, and so does my partner when I get home. The brightened effect and smoothness are still tangible a week later.</p>\n<p><strong>Find out more</strong></p>\n<p>Spa InterContinental is at 1 Hamilton Place, London W1J 7QY.

She reaches her apartment's wall of windows and...<em>wow.</em> There's the Hudson River: almost all of it, it seems, so startlingly close you could practically dive in. \"I'm a water person,\" she says, smiling so peacefully you'd never know that she got up at 3:45 this morning (as usual) and has been on the go-go-go ever since &#151; while getting over a bad cold. She spent much of her childhood in Pass Christian, MS, right on the Gulf of Mexico, and of water she says, \"That's <em>home.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Having a river to soothe her and remind her of childhood is just one of many ways the 51-year-old star of ABC's <em>Good Morning America</em> keeps herself emotionally and spiritually nourished, upbeat, and calm despite a killer work schedule, a high-stress job, and, five years ago, a diagnosis with a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer.</p>\n<p>After soaking up the river view, Robin sinks into her white couch with her pooch, KJ, scampering underfoot. (\"KJ\" is short for \"Killer Jack\" &#151; \"Jack\" because she's a Jack Russell terrier and \"Killer\" because she was so docile as a puppy. Welcome to Robin's world of irony.)</p>\n<p>It's good to be Robin Roberts right now. First of all, <em>GMA</em>'s ratings have recently been the highest in five years, \"and it's just energized all of us,\" she enthuses. And Robin has been shining especially brightly since her star turn at the Oscars a few months ago, when she earned kudos on the red carpet in a shimmery white sheath that fit her body &#151; pretty killer itself &#151; like a second skin. She shares the true backstory of that triumphant night: Her dress kept riding up; her stylists determined that the Spanx she had on were the culprit, so she had no choice but to remove them. Though none of the millions of viewers had any idea, she was bantering with A-listers with <em>no</em> underwear on. Because the Oscars commentators tend to leave no detail of celebrities' looks un &#151; remarked upon, some insisted that Robin's great figure was courtesy of derriere-enhancing briefs. She pretends to be insulted that she didn't get credit: \"I'm old school! I did squats at the gym for six weeks for that! I wasn't wearing anything!\"</p>\n<p>In fact, she's not a woman who usually spends a lot of time thinking or talking about appearances. Much closer to her heart are her family and her faith &#151; and she's very happy about a slender book that sits on her coffee table, which combines both. The book is <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0835811077/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=goodhousekeeping-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0835811077\" target=\"_blank\">My Story, My Song</a> </em>(see excerpt, \"<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/my-story-my-song-robin-roberts-book\">Knowing That Home Is Wherever We Are,</a>\"), and Robin's 88-year-old mother, Lucimarian Roberts, wrote it about her own inspiring life, with Robin popping in to offer reflections at the end of each chapter. Lucimarian grew up during the Depression and amid segregation; her hard-pressed family was dispossessed of much of their furniture when she was young. Yet as the wife of an Air Force colonel who was one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, she was a fiercely proper lady \"who was elegant even when serving us franks and beans &#151; we always had dinner by candlelight,\" Robin recalls. An angel-voiced hymn singer \"who was never happier than when someone said they saw one of her children in church,\" Lucimarian was also a perfectionist stay-at-home mom who painstakingly raised four college graduates (Robin's the youngest) and then launched a robust life serving on several boards and commissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Next: <a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/robin-roberts-interview-2\" target=\"_self\">Robin's formula for living life with gratitude and gusto</a></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-09T13:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"988360","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/bR/robin-roberts-standing-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Weller","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"jfields","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372757","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/family/marriage-sex/dr-phil-marriage-makeover\">Dr. Phil &amp; Robin's Do-It-Yourself Marriage Makeover</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home/robin-wilson-bio\">About Robin Wilson</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/how-to-host-a-cookie-swap\">How-To Host A Cookie Swap</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/party-spill-confess-jan07\">You Messed Up Your Host's Sofa -- Should You Confess?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/holidays/hostess-gifts-for-summer\">8 Super Summer Host Gifts</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/etiquette/pet-allergy-peggy-dec-04\">Allergic to Host's Pets</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/books-interview-trigiani-sept05\">Interview with Adriana Trigiani</a><br>\n<a href=\"/family/celebrity-interviews/michael-j-fox-interview\">Interview with Michael J.

in the <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/may-2012-contents\">May 2012 issue</a></i></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Presuming to speak </b>for most of us, I'll just say that we seem to maintain the delicate balance of our lives reasonably certain that almost everyone else in the world is lunatic, and that it is our duty to future generations to stand as a bulwark in the face of all the madness. Appearances can be so tiresome. And every so often, a book &#151; <i>a book!</i> &#151; gives you license to just give up the game, for fk's sake. Good for us that John Irving has always had a lovely and highly entertaining way of demonstrating just how crazy we all are. In his thirteenth novel, <i>In One Person </i>(Simon & Schuster, $28), Irving goes out on a limb and writes about the subject of debilitating sexual differences. Of course, Irving has written a lot about debilitating sexual differences his entire career, or at least ever since the nicely adjusted transsexual Roberta Muldoon in <i>The World According to Garp.</i> It is important to add that with Irving it is most often not the sexually different who are the debilitated ones but those around them. In fact, Irving's life could be described as a noble campaign to define deviancy out of existence. Billy Abbott, his latest protagonist, possesses a difference that is hardly different at all. He's gay. Or a \"bi-guy,\" as Irving says. A bi-guy who came of age before AIDS and who becomes a full-fledged deviant, or perfectly normal person, during the epidemic. With that, <i>In One Person </i>marks a milestone for Irving, a tipping point, to use that ruined phrase: From now on, the truly deviant will be the ones &#151; the scowling churchmen and reprobates who cast everyone into hell &#151; who cease to live their own lives while telling everybody else how to live theirs. Oh, don't think you'll get away without transsexuals &#151; there are transsexuals &#151; but <i>In One Person </i>is a rich and absorbing book, even beautiful, and probably the most different book of Irving's long career. One might guess that he queued up this book special, just in time to snuff out the last gasp of homosexual panic in the American polity (last, that is, until the next one), to achieve a novel ripped from the culture wars. But when reached on the phone at his house in Vermont, he says no. </p>\n\n\n<img src=\"/cm/esquire/images/UN/esq-in-one-person-0512-lg.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" />\n\n<p>\"In my case, there are always these novels, three or four, that I am going to write, and they are like boxcars in a station. They're kind of waiting around, and I never know which of those boxcars is going to leave the station,\" he says. \"I never try to predetermine these things. In some cases, these are stories that are fully formed, that may have been waiting to be the next novel for 20 years. <i>Twisted River </i>was hanging around for that length of time before I wrote it. <i>Until I Find You </i>was hanging around for that length of time before I wrote it. <i>In One Person </i>was also fully formed. It had been in my head for seven, almost eight years before I began to write it in June 2009. And yet when I began it, I never would have guessed even a week before that it would be the next one. It may seem to a reader who takes to this novel now, especially with the rampant homophobia among the Republican candidates for president, that it may be a timely moment for this boxcar to leave the station. But I don't work that way.\" He laughs. \"The book that becomes the next one for me is the one in which the ending is the most fully formed. I always know that ending before I begin. I have that written, and then I begin at the beginning and make my way there through some pretty intricate turns.</p><p>\"As for a novel that deals with sexuality as a predominant theme, I must say that when I began I thought, <i>This again?</i> But then, when you look at us, and you see just how utterly juvenile we are about all things sexual, you say with conviction <i>Yes, this again.</i>\" This again, this always. </p><p>It's hard to compare Irving to anybody else, and why would you want to? A major literary figure who has always been somehow outside the milieu of such things, who writes large books exalting marginal figures because we are all marginal figures. Thirty years ago, Billy would have been so different as to be dangerous. But the world, at last, seems to be catching up with John Irving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p><i>Below, read an extended conversation between John Irving and Mark Warren about </i>In One Person<i>.</i></p>\n\n<p><b>ESQUIRE:</b> Why <i>In One Person</i>, why now? Where does the main character, Billy Abbott, come from?</p>\n\n<p><b>JOHN IRVING:</b> I never know when I finish the novel I am writing which will be the next novel out of the station. When I began <i>In One Person</i> in June of 2009, I never would have guessed just a week before that it was the next novel. There were novels in my head that had been waiting longer. So the \"now\" word is deceptive. It may seem, given the rampant homophobia among Republicans running for president, that it may be a timely moment for this boxcar to move itself out of the station, but I don't work that way.</p>\n\n<p>So forget about the now. My Vietnam novel, <i>A Prayer for Owen Meany</i>, was published in 1989, quite a number of years after the end of the Vietnam War in April of '75. My abortion novel, <i>The Cider House Rules</i>, was purposely set back in time, not only long before Roe v. Wade, but at that period of time when orphanages were prevalent in New England, and where &#151; in the '30s and '40s, before antibiotics, when the only procedure for an abortion was a D&C, and a lot of them were performed in orphanages. I purposely chose to make it historical, to basically say, Okay, so you want to go back to these wonderful days? Here's a novel in which everything that happens happens because this procedure is illegal, unavailable, and unsafe. And if you make this procedure legal, available, and safe, nothing in this story ever happens &#151; nothing, these people don't exist.</p>\n\n<p>So, I don't work in terms of real time. I don't work in a timely fashion. If <i>In One Person</i> is timely, it's a fucking accident. Not to put too fine a point on it.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think sexual outsiders, or sexual misfits, are particularly new to my novels. Dr. Larch in <i>The Cider House Rules</i> has sex once and stops for life. That's a little strange. Jenny Fields, Garp's mother, does the same thing. Those are eccentric sexual choices. More eccentric, I would argue, than Billy Abbott's in <i>In One Person</i>. There's Frank, the gay brother in <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>, kind of the brains of the family. There are the gay twins, separated at birth, in <i>A Son of the Circus</i>, who have nothing in common but for the fact that they're gay, which is a lot to have in common. And so when you say, \"Where does Billy come from?\" &#151; he comes from all of these other guys that I've been writing about frequently, not least the narrator of <i>A Prayer for Owen Meany</i>, who is called &#151; behind his back and to his considerable irritation &#151; a \"non-practicing homosexual.\" But the truth about Johnny Wheelright is that he looks like one of the gay guys from my generation who not only isn't out of the closet, he wouldn't ever admit that he's in the closet. Billy's voice was a lot easier to write in because he's so out. But Billy has a long ancestry in my work.</p>\n\n<p>I was living in New York in the 1980s when the AIDS epidemic began. I lost friends to early death. <i>In One Person</i> is dedicated in part to one of them, Tony Richardson. All of my characters, in all of my novels, are on a collision course. In this novel, AIDS is the collision in waiting.</p>\n\n<p>One coincidence did force this novel ahead of all the others waiting in my head. The novelist Edmund White and I were exchanging emails during the May-June 2009 period when I was about to begin writing on something else. \"What are you working on now?\" he asked. It turned out we were both beginning novels at the same time. (He writes faster than I do &#151; he finished <i>Jack Holmes and His Friend</i> before I finished <i>In One Person</i>.) And I was at that point when I wasn't sure what to write. I ended up telling him much more about a novel I didn't start, but I did include a side note about this one. I mentioned the beginning relationship between Billy and Ms. Frost, about a boy who falls in love with a transsexual whom he doesn't know is a transsexual, and that this is the pivotal relationship in his life that informs all the others that he will have. But then I said, \"But I don't think I'm going to write this one now, because I know it's a first-person novel, and I don't like to write in the first-person,\" and that I was confused about who was the most important character and who was the main character. That same mistake prevented me from writing <i>Cider House Rules</i> for several years.</p>\n\n<p>So I was bitching in an email to Edmund, saying, \"Oh God, this novel is impossible. I don't like writing from the point-of-view of the transgender woman. I can't do it.\" And Edmund wrote back, just as an aside to something else: \"Why aren't you writing from the point-of-view of the boy, Billy Abbott?\"</p>\n\n<p>And I remember clearly &#151; I was on this island in Canada that I live on in the summers &#151; and one morning I went down with the dog, and saw the thing from Edmund, innocently asking his question. And I went back up to the main cabin &#151; a walk of about five minutes &#151; and by the time I got there, I knew exactly what I needed to be doing.</p>\n\n<p><b>ESQ:</b> Some of the sexual differences in some of your other novels are seen in the times in which the novels take place as so aberrant. But Billy's difference is not so different. And he's so angry and self-knowing and kind of fearless. Do we improve over time? Are we growing up and changing, at last?</p>\n\n<p><b>JI:</b> Well, as you say, <i>The World According to Garp</i>, for instance, is a much more radical polarization story about sexual differences. It's a novel in which a woman, Garp's mother, is murdered by a man who hates women, and her son, Garp himself, is murdered by a woman who hates men. It was always a very radical and cynical view of our retrograde view of sex. It was written in the late 1970s, and it said, essentially, Oh, you think we're so liberated sexually. Well, I don't think so. Men and women still treat each other like shit. And I was na&#239;ve enough when I finished <i>The World According to Garp</i> to think, Well, whatever you write about in the future, you're not going to write about this stupid subject again. This is going to go away. There isn't going to be any more intolerance for sexual differences. Well, that was obviously a joke. I got that wrong. This book is essentially about the same subject, not as radicalized, which is why Billy is more recognizable, more \"normal.\" So we change, yes, but at a shockingly slow pace. Tolerance for abortion rights, for instance, is worse today that it was in '85 when I published <i>Cider House Rules</i>. And opposition to it &#151; and to women in general &#151; is more incendiary now than ever.</p>\n\n<p>The troglodytes will always be enflamed by behavior that is sexually unacceptable to them. Intolerance for gays comes from the same fount that says that if you're young and you get knocked up before you're married, you should Pay. The. Price. Penalize it. Long before there was all this right-to-life bullshit on behalf of the fetus, there was that. There were and apparently always will be the anti-promiscuity people. The same people who viewed the AIDS epidemic as a rightful and just plague. Think of them. When I hear the ad nauseum mismemory of Ronald Reagan that is preached to us daily by young conservatives who were not politically conscious when Reagan was president, it makes me sick. And he was an absent president during a time of profound crisis.  And think of it: Did we ever have a president who personally knew more gay people than Reagan? He came from Hollywood, and many of his friends were affected, and he didn't give a shit about it.</p>\n\n<p>Before I wrote <i>In One Person</i>, I thought, Oh, for God's sake, not this again. But then I look at who and what we are, and I just knew, Yes, this again. This for as long as it takes. For as long as this rich story continues to tell itself.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of few countries &#151; especially civilized countries &#151; that are as juvenile, utterly puerile, as ours, sexually.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-08T17:41:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"1060","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Warren","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"mattsullivan","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8160562","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

src=\"/cm/cosmopolitanuk/images/J2/02-080512-birthday-blues-mdn--gIpl0G.jpg\n\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;\"></p>\n\n<p>It&#146;s my 28th birthday this week and I feel like my subconscious is preparing itself for some kind of apocalyptic breakdown. I have never freaked out about getting older, but 28 is the age I thought all teachers were when I was at school - and they were all creaky-backed ancient loafer-wearers, ergo, in my head, 28 was passed it. Defunct. Decrepit. The cool and trendy teachers who came to class with hangovers and wore neckerchiefs were all either 26 or 27, so to me that was a perfectly acceptable age to be. 28, however, was and is terrifying. And now here it is &#150; happening to me.</p> \n\n<p>I know everyone always says 30 or 35 is The Big One. At 30 or 35 you&#146;re allowed to go a bit mad, dump your fella, buy one of those fold-up bikes and join a commune. But 28 is my 30. It&#146;s the specific age I&#146;d picked out as a whippersnapper when I believed I&#146;d have everything sorted. I&#146;d be the youngest ever recipient of the Pulitzer Fiction Prize, I&#146;d be richer than Simon Cowell and I&#146;d have been Oscar nominated for my role in the latest genre-defining Hollywood comic book adaptation.</p> \n\n<p>None of these things have happened. And I have a feeling it&#146;s too late. Although technically I still have three and a half years to be the youngest ever Pulitzer Fiction Prize winner as Jhumpa Lahiri still holds the record from when she won in 2000 at age 32. Realising that has actually made me feel a little better. I&#146;m going to write &#145;win Pulitzer&#146; back on my life to-do list &#150; in pen so I know I&#146;m serious. The other things though (the Oscar and being richer than Simon Cowell) aren&#146;t going to happen and I feel massively bummed out having to come to terms with that. Deep down I&#146;ve always thought that one day I might jack everything in, move to Hollywood and dedicate myself to acting until Ridley Scott sees me sauntering along the street and thinks, &#147;I&#146;m going to make that girl a STAR.&#148; Turning 28 has made me acknowledge that I don&#146;t actually want to jack everything in. I quite like stuff how it is&#133;but how is Ridley Scott going to realise I&#146;m his new muse if I&#146;m sitting at home watching Homeland? Eugh, I&#146;m so confused.</p> \n\n<p>On the day I turned 27 last year a guy I was working with politely informed me that 27 was the age Paul McCartney left The Beatles. I haven&#146;t even started The Beatles so how am I going to leave them? Don&#146;t get me wrong, there are lots of things I&#146;ve achieved that I&#146;m massively chuffed with, but that&#146;s the problem &#150; I actually don&#146;t want to do all those things I&#146;ve grown up convincing myself I do as I&#146;m happy where I am. Which is great, but a bit weird, really. My inner child is still screaming, &#147;But I wanna be a rock star!&#148;</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has their own &#145;scary age&#146;. The number that they thought was a million billion miles away when they were a kid. Loads of my friends are older than me and haven&#146;t had panic attacks over their birthdays. I think I need to slap myself, grow up and embrace the fact that while I haven&#146;t won an Oscar I did win Player Of The Season in our local netball league, which is just as good, if not better as some of the competition were petrifying. So, come Terrifying Thursday (aka my birthday) I&#146;m just going to eat cake and be merry. And look into buying one of those little fold-up bikes.</p> \n\n<p>For more inane ramblings please follow me on <a title=\"https://twitter.com/#!/jousmar href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/jousmar\"

PREP SKIN </strong></p>\n<p>Exfoliate regularly for the smoothest results: For shavers, it helps to stop the blade from dulling; wait 24 hours before shaving to minimize skin irritation. \"For waxers, it removes dead skin covering hairs so the wax can reach them and pull them out,\" says waxing expert Malynda Vigliotti. Try Nivea Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub ($6, drugstores).</p>\n<p><strong>2. SKIP THE BAR SOAP </strong></p>\n<p>\"It doesn't create enough lubrication for a razor to slide easily against your skin, which can up the odds of cuts,\" says New York City dermatologist Ellen Gendler, M.D. Choose a moisturizing shaving cream or try a razor with built-in moisturizers, like Gillette Venus & Olay Razor ($10, drugstores) or Schick Hydro Silk ($10, drugstores).</p>\n<p><strong>3. MINIMIZE WAXING PAIN</strong></p>\n<p>Forgo your morning latte. \"Caffeine, a stimulant, heightens your nervous system, intensifying pain,\" says Lura Jones of Stark Waxing Studio at Face Place New York City. And forgo waxing the week before your menstrual cycle, when skin is especially sensitive. To further curb pain, take an ibuprofen half an hour before your appointment.</p>\n<p><strong>4. LOAD UPON SPF</strong></p>\n<p>Be diligent about sun protection after any type of hair removal, particularly waxing: \"It removes the top layers of skin, making you more susceptible than usual to sunburn,\" explains Jones. For areas like the upper lip that are prone to discoloration (a condition made worse by sun exposure), consider skipping waxing altogether and opt for a depilatory or threading.</p>\n<p><strong>5. APPLY A SKIN SOOTHER </strong></p>\n<p>Resist the urge to slather on heavy lotions, which clog hair follicles and pores. Instead, dab on an over-the-counter hydrocortisone lotion post-shave or -wax to reduce redness and bumps, and postpone the gym for at least a few hours afterward, says Jones. \"Salt and other ingredients in sweat can exacerbate irritation and cause stinging.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"984615","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19815","promo_image_url":"/cm/goodhousekeeping/images/ap/razor-shaving-legs-msc.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cbuffamonte","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8372748","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/beauty/how-to-get-smooth-skin\">5 Ways to Get Fuzz-Free Skin </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/skin-issues-and-easy-solutions\">Problems Brewing Under Your Skin ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/anti-aging/radiant-skin-apr04\">Your Road Map to Radiant Skin </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/dry-skin-workbook-jan07\">The Dry-Skin Workbook</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/summer-makeup\">Summer Hair and Makeup Tips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/winter-dry-skin-care\">Revitalize Dry Winter Skin </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty/skin-care-mistakes\">Nine Skin -Care Mistakes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/recipes/cooking-tips/remove-chicken-skin\">Removing Skin from a Raw Chicken</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health/prevent-skin-cancer\">12 Ways to Protect Your Skin and Prevent Skin Cancer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/product-reviews/anti-aging-hair-products\">Anti-Aging Hair Products</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-06T11:40:17.000Z","author_id":"37682","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"goodhousekeeping","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2030-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Good Housekeeping","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"0","canonical_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/anti-aging/how-to-get-smooth-skin","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Follow our fitness guide for the best summer beach body","site_id":"15","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.goodhousekeeping.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"fitness, muffin top, flat stomach, tighter abs, best exercises for flat stomach, lose muffin top fast, flat belly diet, get a flat tummy, flatten tummy","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"How to Get a Flat Tummy &#151;

found in oats, beans, fruits, and veggies &#151; shrinks belly fat. A study from Wake Forest found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fiber people ate daily (about two small apples, a serving of oatmeal, a half cup of pinto beans, and a half cup of peas), their belly fat decreased by almost 4% over five years.</p>\n<p><strong>FIGHT WITH FIBER:</strong> Adding ground flaxseed to your diet &#151; mix a teaspoon or two into cereal or yogurt &#151; helps prevent constipation. (It's hard to have flat abs if your pipes are backed up.) To avoid stomachaches, increase fiber slowly and up your water intake, advises Jessica Crandall, R.D., spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>\n<p><strong>GO FOR A FAT BLAST:</strong> In a Duke University study of 196 sedentary, overweight adults, aerobic training significantly reduced deep belly fat and also burned more visible midsection flab. To maximize the benefit with a minimum time commitment, try interval training, suggests exercise physiologist Jessica Matthews of the American Council on Exercise. Start with a 1:2 ratio (jog 30 seconds, then walk briskly for a minute), aiming for 150 minutes weekly.</p>\n\n<br />\n<h3>Posture Perfect</h3>\n<p>Standing tall, with tummy and butt tucked in, automatically makes your front look flatter. These two moves help you pull it off. Do each two to three times per week; work up to three sets of 12 reps.</p>\n<p><strong>Glute Bridge:</strong> Lie on back with bent knees, feet on floor. Lift butt, drawing pelvis to the ceiling without arching back. Lower butt down slowly.</p>\n<p><strong>Bird Dog:</strong> From all fours, extend one arm and the opposite leg to shoulder and hip height simultaneously, keeping shoulders and hips squared to the floor. Lower slowly to start, and repeat on opposite side.</p>\n\n<br />\n<h3>It Takes Two to Flatten</h3>\n\n<p><b>Front Plank:</b></p>\n<p>A. Lie on stomach, with forearms on floor and hands palm-down on either side of chest.</p>\n<p>B. Tuck toes, lift legs, tighten abs, and raise body to a modified push-up position, keeping forearms on the floor. Hold five seconds, then lower.</p>\n<p>C. Repeat three times. Work up to holding for 20 seconds each time.</p>\n\n<p><b>Half-Kneel Lift:</b></p>\n<p>A. Kneel on right knee, with left foot forward and left knee at 90-degree angle. Hold a soccer ball with both hands at right hip.</p>\n<p>B. Without rotating body, slowly bring ball up and across until it's above left shoulder and slightly behind you. Return to start.</p>\n<p>C.

Ask me for lower-cost alternatives.</strong> \"These days there are lots of excellent choices of certain medications at significantly different prices, and these choices may also be reimbursed by your health plan at different rates,\" says Nancy Davis, RPh, pharmacy manager at a Walgreens in Glencoe, IL. This includes brand-name drugs as well as generic medications. Your pharmacist (or you) can call your doctor to come up with the most affordable option. However, Davis adds, \"in certain cases your doctor may want you to go with a newer, more expensive medication because it can get you back on the road to recovery more quickly.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2. Join a discount program.</strong> \"Many pharmacies offer programs that can save you 20% to 90% on generic drugs. These programs may not necessarily be publicized, so ask!\" advises Stacia Woodcock, PharmD, a pharmacist at a Walgreens in New York City. Walmart and Target offer hundreds of generics at $4 a month. Walgreens and CVS charge a small annual fee for similar savings on generics, and some independent pharmacies offer competitive prices.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Get the coupons.</strong> \"If you're on a brand-name medication and you haven't looked to see if there's a coupon, you may be missing out on some serious savings,\" says Ryan Frerichs, PharmD, of Meyer Health Mart Pharmacy in Waverly, IA. \"Many manufacturers have a coupon program you can sign up for that will save you $10 to $50 a month on one drug.\" Go to the Web and type in \"coupon\" and the drug name, suggests Davis, or ask your pharmacist to check online for you. Doctors and pharmacies also receive coupons from drug reps, so ask if they have any, Davis says. \"But don't bother looking for generic medication coupons,\" Dr. Frerichs adds. \"They don't exist.\"</p>\n<p><strong>4. You may be covered for OTC products.</strong> \"A lot of insurers pay for certain over-the-counter drugs, sometimes with no copay,\" says Lisa Faast, PharmD, owner of Faast Pharmacy in Bakersfield, CA. Also, your pharmacist can ask your doctor for a prescription for such items as diabetic test strips, which are almost always covered, says Dr. Frerichs. To check your coverage, call the number on your insurance card.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Fill all your prescriptions at one pharmacy.</strong> \"You may see several different doctors, who may not know all the drugs and supplements you're taking,\" says Dr. Woodcock. \"If I have your whole history, I can make sure everything is compatible and safe.\" Chain and many independent pharmacies have computer systems that red-flag any possible interactions. \"But I still look through your profile for every prescription I sell,\" says Dr. Woodcock.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Consult me on OTC drugs, too.</strong> \"I see people contemplating boxes in the aisle for 20 minutes,\" says Dr. Frerichs. \"With all the health information on the Internet, people get paralysis by analysis, trying to make the 'right' choice. In reality, on all those shelves of cold remedies, there are only about 10 different ingredients. The pharmacist can hear your symptoms and recommend a product immediately.\"</p>\n<p><strong>7. Time your visit right.</strong> The busiest times at pharmacies vary by location, but a few guidelines seem to apply. \"Tuesday through Thursday are less busy, so your wait will be shorter and the pharmacist can spend more time with you,\" says Dr. Faast. What time of day is best? \"Between 10 A.M. and noon and 2 and 4 P.M.,\" says Dr. Woodcock. Also, try not to come in on the first of the month, suggests Dr. Faast. \"That's when some people get paid and Medicaid benefits are renewed.\"</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-07T15:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"987357","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"20709","promo_image_url":"/cm/womansday/images/O4/pharmacist-insider-secrets-275.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Gianetti","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"agekas","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8024341","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2012-05-09T21:34:01.000Z","author_id":"38064","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"womansday","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2036-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Woman's Day","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.womansday.com/health-fitness/conditions-diseases/pharmacy-information","issue_date":"Woman's Day; June 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Interested in a new scent?

Poll: Have you picked up a jump rope since grade school? I recently found myself in a boot-camp-fitness situation in a sweaty muscle gym (first bad sign) that incorporated the playground staple &#151; and I couldn't fathom why I had ever found it a recess-worthy activity. Pathetically stumbling and tripping through the workout, I was shocked at how difficult it was, and after, I slunk out, dejected. (Did I just pay for this humiliation?) But at another class I attended later that week, I found myself bouncing around again &#151; this time on a trampoline &#151; and had quite the opposite experience: I don't think I've ever had so much fun exercising since, well, grade school.</p>\n<p>Evidently, I'm not alone. It seems the nation has suddenly become smitten with the simple act of jumping up and down. \"Trampoline parks,\" fitness/play centers for the whole family, are cropping up all over the country. One major chain, Sky Zone Sports, has recently opened 18 of them, with 10 more scheduled to roll out in cities like Dallas and Cleveland over the next year. We'll be watching trampoline gymnastics at the Olympics in London this summer, and innovative new classes on rebounders (those mini personal trampolines) are springing up at boutique fitness studios from coast to coast. In L.A., there's On the Rebound at the ESP Wellness Center (<a href=\"http://www.espwellnesscenter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">espwellnesscenter.com</a>) and Jump at Ballet Bodies (<a href=\"http://www.balletbodies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">balletbodies.com</a>); in New York City, there's Trampoline Yoga at Shen Tao (<a href=\"http://www.shentaostudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shentaostudio.com</a>) and Bari Bounce at Bari Studio (<a href=\"http://www.thebaristudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">thebaristudio.com</a>).</p>\n<p>Here's why this seemingly juvenile trend is a very, very good thing for everyone involved: 1) A trampoline workout is easy on the joints; people with sports injuries and other issues are protected by the low-impact cushion of the net. 2) It's detoxifying. Jumping up and down stimulates the lymphatic drainage system, which is why experts at the world-famous We Care fasting spa near Palm Springs &#151; where stars go to drop 5 to 10 pounds fast &#151; recommend their tony clients jump on mini trampolines throughout their stays. 3) It's accessible. Besides all the trampoline parks opening up everywhere, anyone can purchase a relatively affordable rebounder (about $40) and sneak in a few bounces during TV hour. 4) It's also highly efficient. Studies show that jumping on a trampoline burns about 20 percent more calories than jogging at five miles per hour. And according to Parvati Shallow, teacher of ESP Wellness Center's new trampoline class, six minutes on the rebounder can equal one mile of jogging. And did I mention it's really, really fun?</p>\n<p>Addicted to the feeling of flying through the air with the greatest of ease, I hightail it to Bari's Bounce class, where I first got hooked. Co-owners Alexandra Perez and Brice Andrew Hall, a trainer who has worked with Madonna, claim Bounce further improves on the already propitious trampoline workout. \"People need cardio [like running] in their workout routines, but we found too many clients were prone to shin splints, foot problems, and other issues that interfere with exercise,\" says Perez. \"For Bounce, we've choreographed strategic sequences on the trampoline that activate more muscles &#151; and in different ways &#151; to burn more calories and engage you cognitively, so you also benefit in areas like strength, balance, and coordination.\" In other words, clients find themselves doing a lot more than simply bouncing on the spot, and it translates to maximum results. During the class, we learn dance-y routines that require quick thinking and take us up, down, and all around the trampolines; plus we pull resistance bands hanging from the ceiling, squeeze exercise balls between our legs, and perform interval push-ups and other strength-training exercises off the side of the thing (which makes for some serious core work). It's exhausting but enjoyable, and you can immediately feel how full-bodied the workout is. While just jumping on a trampoline still packs major benefits, the new versions of rebounding workouts are on speed.</p>\n<p>The other day, I received an invitation to check out NYC's <em>Sex and the City</em> &#151; famous trapeze school. But unlike Carrie Bradshaw, I'm not sure heights are my style (unless I'm flying first class, that is). Luckily, they also now offer a Big Top &#151; style trampoline class, which instantly transports me back to childhood, jumping around in a neighbor's yard at dusk with that feeling of pure, unadulterated joy. Sounds like a perfect workout high.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-05-07T14:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Flaherty","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"8122924","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

Learn how to protect yourself by following the steps below.</p>\n<p><strong>If your identity is stolen, follow these five steps:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Put a fraud alert on your credit reports. You only have to contact one credit bureau (<a href=\"http://www.equifax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Equifax.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Experian.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.transunion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TransUnion.com</a>). They, in turn, will alert the other two.</p>\n<p>2. Get copies of your credit reports. Once you place a fraud alert, you're entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each credit bureau. Check each report for unauthorized charges.</p>\n<p>3. Notify your bank, creditors and utility companies about any affected accounts. Speak to someone in the security or fraud department; follow up in writing.</p>\n<p>4. Call 877-IDTHEFT or visit <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">FTC.gov</a> to alert the Federal Trade Commission.</p>\n<p>5. File a police report. It will be helpful if creditors want proof of a crime.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>5 Signs of Identity Theft</strong></p>\n<p>1. Your mail goes missing. If you stop receiving bills, bank statements or other mail, it could mean that an ID thief has changed the address on those accounts.</p>\n<p>2. You're denied a credit card, a loan or a mortgage, even though you have an excellent credit history. Someone may have racked up charges in your name that were never paid, destroying your credit rating.</p>\n<p>3. You receive bills for goods or services you didn't buy. The unexpected bills are a red flag that your credit card information was most likely stolen.</p>\n<p>4.
