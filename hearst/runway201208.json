They expand in your stomach and keep you full longer. When added to liquid, the seeds can expand to <em>ten</em> times their size!

Today it aims to do much, much more: hydrate skin, minimize wrinkles, diminish lines on lips. And not just while you're wearing it: Like lotions and serums, anti-aging makeup vows to deliver skin benefits over time, so you'll eventually look better even when you don't have it on.</p>\n\n<p>Skeptical? We were, too. Last summer, we began a yearlong project to determine, scientifically, if any of the myriad anti-aging cosmetics lived up to their claims &#151; eye shadows that say they don't crease, lipliners that are supposedly anti-feathering, and primers that promise to hide lines.

They filled out questionnaires, came to our lab for skin analyses done with high-tech equipment, and went home with the test brands.* The good news: The bold claims aren't all marketing hype.

Pippa also shares a few stories about holidays growing up with her famous sis Kate. Oh, and it's $50.\n<br /><br />\nWe know you guys love Pippa as much as we do, but would you shell out $50 for her party planning tips? \n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"TWIIGSPOLL\"> <script

Due to strong winds, the mission was called off, rescheduled for this coming Sunday. That far from terra firma, the atmospheric pressure is roughly 1% what we experience at ground level. There is nothing &#8211; almost literally &#8211; to slow him down, so when he falls, he&#8217;s going to fall fast. In fact, his team on the Red Bull Stratos mission expect that he will break the sound barrier, something no human has done without the aid of a large and expensive jet plane.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it will feel going through the sound barrier,&#8221; Baumgartner says. &#8220;That&#8217;s a big unknown, and it's one of the main things this mission is aiming to find out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a mission of huge scientific endeavour because if the Red Bull team can get Baumgartner down safely in his custom-built pressurised suit, the technology could be used for future human spaceflight, be that Nasa missions or future space tourism. But that is one stratospheric &#8216;if&#8217;. The mission is riddled with danger. There are hundreds of things that could go wrong and cost Baumgartner his life. He has to be ready.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #91b513;\">The demands</span></h2>\n<p>&#8232;Aside from the intensive, technical training required to get Baumgartner to the edge of space and back again, he has also hit the gym hard to ensure his mind and body are prepared. &#8220;There is a volume of <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/blogs/different-class/crossfit-exercise-class-blog?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">baseline training</a> that we have Felix on just so he can sustain the days and weeks of training that he has to do,&#8221; says Red Bull high performance director Andy Walshe. &#8220;The specific technical training in the capsule, the travel, the meetings. It&#8217;s cardio respiratory that allows him to cope with the volume time and energy required during the run-up to the mission. The fitter you are, the longer you can sustain your concentration levels, and the better you can recover. That&#8217;s training to support the training.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then there's the mission specifics. As well as <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/healthy/brain-training/focus-dammit-240306?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">mental focus</a>, he has had to build the strength required to move around in an awkward, heavy pressurised suit. &#8220;There is also a slight altitude effect,&#8221; says Walshe, factoring in the artificial atmosphere of the suit. &#8220;It&#8217;s around the equivalent of 10-15,000ft, mildly increasing aerobic demand on the body. But it requires a bit of work just to breathe in this suit. It&#8217;s probably comparable to the regulator in a diving suit. You&#8217;re breathing pretty easily but it&#8217;s still more challenging than the every day breathing you're used to.&#8221;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #91b513;\">The training</span></h2>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in <em>good</em> shape, right up there with world-class athletes,&#8221; Walshe says of Baumgartner, who has mixed intensive cardio work, boxing training and kettlebell sessions in preparation. &#8220;We've also integrated some of the cognitive challenges he&#8217;ll face on the mission, like mission control scenarios. So while he&#8217;s on the bike and he&#8217;s struggling a little bit, I&#8217;ll have him rehearse Evacuation Plan C or Fire Drill A. I want him to be challenged physically <em>and</em> still deliver higher executive function cognition. It&#8217;s a great way to ensure you&#8217;re making the right decisions under extreme pressure.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Turn the page to sample Baumgartner's workout yourself...</span></em></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-10-08T08:25:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-bkennedy","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11976019","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":"August '12 p75","print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-10-11T09:30:43.000Z","author_id":"9322","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"menshealthuk","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2027-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Men's Health","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/felix-baumgartner-fitness","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Easy Thanksgiving Recipes","site_id":"13","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.esquire.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"Thanksgiving recipes, thanksgiving appetizers, Thanksgiving, thanksgiving side dishes, artichoke dip recipe","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Easy Thanksgiving Recipes","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-11-13T17:40:39.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/features/best-thanksgiving-appetizers-sides","link_text":"Thanksgiving Appetizers and Side Dishes"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/features/easy-thanksgiving-recipes","link_text":"Thanksgiving Recipes : From Turkey to Ham (and a cocktail in between)"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/the-side/recipes-from-1984/william-f-buckley-recipe-thanksgiving-pheasant-chestnut-cornbread-stuffing-1184","link_text":"William F.

Do you know what you&#8217;ll be doing from the moment you wake up to the second your head hits the pillow? How about in a month&#8217;s time? If your routine is drearily familiar, it&#8217;s time to break free from the daily grind of work, housework and parenting, which can leave you frustrated, uninspired and trapped. &#8216;As women, we have a tendency to be people-pleasers,&#8217; says Suzy Greaves, author of 'Making the Big Leap: 7 Steps to Living a Brave, Inspired and Great Life' (New Holland, &#163;8.99). &#8216;But everyday life can be wearing without an emotional pay-off.&#8217; Here are some ways to shake things up:</p>\n<h3>If you&#8217;re stuck in a rut at home...</h3>\n<p><strong>Change how you think</strong><br />&#8216;Alter your state of mind and the normal way you do things,&#8217; says psychotherapist Phil Parker. &#8216;The more we do things habitually, the more slowly our brain functions, so make a conscious decision to mix things up.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>Brighten up your routine </strong>&#8216;Do the same, but differently,&#8217; says Phil. If you&#8217;re doing chores, stick on music you love to make it less dull. Listen to a language tape on your daily commute. Go to Sainsbury&#8217;s instead of Tesco. When the kids finish their dinner, don&#8217;t rush to wash up. &#8216;We spend too much time cleaning and not enough time having fun. The fi rst sign of boredom is losing your sense of humour, so start doing things that make you laugh more.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>Break your patterns</strong><br />If every week you cook the same meals or watch TV after dinner, you need to break out of your comfortable but boring habits. &#8216;It&#8217;s more effort,&#8217; admits psychologist Corinne Sweet, &#8216;but it&#8217;ll liven things up.&#8217; Add five different ingredients to your weekly shop and rustle up something new, or switch the TV off and play a board game instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick a no-tech time</strong><br />Silence and space away from your phone, computer and TV is a routine-breaker and enables you to sit and talk with your partner or family or have some quiet time alone. &#8216;Find even an hour in your day or evening when you can&#8217;t be contacted, and you&#8217;re not reminded of all the things you have to do,&#8217; says Corinne.</p>\n<p><strong>Top tip</strong> Stuff the routine. &#8216;Turn dinner into a carpet picnic using the contents of your fridge,&#8217; suggests Corinne.</p>\n<h3>If you&#8217;re stuck in a routine at work</h3>\n<p><strong>Discover what&#8217;s missing </strong><br />Whether you&#8217;ve been in the job too long or downgraded to allow for fl exible hours, leaving you mentally unstretched, working life can be one long yawn. Sarah Louise Byrne from <a href=\"http://www.careershifters.org\" target=\"_blank\">Careershifters</a>, suggests first making a checklist of what&#8217;s missing: &#8216;Clarify how much you need to be earning, and what your ultimate work requirements are &#8211; for example, a short commute or low or high responsibility. Then either work towards creating changes within your current job or look for work that meets your key criteria.&#8217;<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Get stuck in </strong><br />Getting involved in the fun side of work can also boost your enjoyment factor. &#8216;Doing a lunchtime sport or organising a quiz night may sound like another item on your to-do list but can do wonders for building ties with colleagues and making you feel more excited about work again,&#8217; says Sarah Louise.<strong><br />Top tip</strong> Put yourself forward for one new task at work. Pushing yourself could open up all sorts of exciting, fresh opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Make connections</strong><br />You can&#8217;t underestimate the importance of networking. &#8216;However busy you are, if you want to energise your working life, it&#8217;s important to consider wider relationships and be more visible,&#8217; says Jennifer Liston Smith, director of coaching at My Family Care. &#8216;Even if you don&#8217;t want to move jobs now, think about where you might want to be in a few years&#8217; time and start making connections online, or at work-related events. Investing in yourself and your future will make everything feel more possible.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>Try something new</strong><br />If you want out altogether, pay the bills with your day job but try out new ideas in your own time. &#8216;You can volunteer or take an evening class, or enlist friends to be test clients for your new coaching/personal training/homemade cake business,&#8217; suggests Sarah Louise.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Reward yourself</strong><br />If all else fails, give yourself a different daily treat. &#8216;Hot chocolate in your lunch hour, a glossy magazine for your commute home &#8211; anything you can look forward to in your working day helps,&#8217; says Mandy Garner of <a href=\"http://www.workingmums.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Working Mums</a>.</p>\n<h3>If you&#8217;re stuck in a routine with your partner...</h3>\n<p><strong>Grab inspiration</strong><br />You come in, busy yourselves with the kids, cook a Monday night spag bol, eat it in front of the telly then nip upstairs for a bath. &#8216;If routine isn&#8217;t a relationship killer, I don&#8217;t know what is,&#8217; says Suzy, who swears by an inspiration jar. &#8216;Anything you read in a paper, magazine or online that interests you, whether it&#8217;s a local comedy night, a Facebook post, a recipe or an activity you can do together as a family, write it on a slip of paper, pop it into the jar then pull one out and use it to inspire nights out or weekends.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t do it all</strong><br />Jennifer recommends doing an audit of tasks every once in a while to change who does what in the home. &#8216;Try to be objective and not get caught up in a blaming game. Work to your strengths but make sure you mix it up, so you&#8217;re not stuck cooking and tidying while he always helps the kids with homework.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br />&#8216;If you&#8217;re bored, you need to address this with your partner,&#8217; says Phil. &#8216;It&#8217;s likely he&#8217;ll be feeling the same, so ask him if he&#8217;s happy or feels as if some energy or excitement is missing. Talk about how you fi rst met and what you used to love doing together and whether there&#8217;s a way you can bring that back.&#8217;<strong><br />Top tip</strong> Surprise him by doing something out of character, even if it&#8217;s just with breakfast or a cup of tea in bed.</p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/wise-words-simple-life\" target=\"_blank\">Words of wisdom for a simple life</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/how-to-be-happy-happiness-secrets\" target=\"_blank\">How to be happier</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/mindfulness-meditation-exercises\" target=\"_blank\">25 ways to make the most of now</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/your-partner/relationship-advice-marriage-boredom\" target=\"_blank\">Is boredom ruining your marriage?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Stay well at work: your complete guide</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-10-05T14:35:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11975959","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-21T14:36:46.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-23T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/Break-out-of-your-rut","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Daniel Coyle studied the learning techniques of top-notch athletes and businesspeople for years.

I smiled and listened, until the redhead beside me playfully nudged my elbow: \"Why mourn our 30s, am I right?\" It's a sentiment I would've gladly toasted... except I'm still <em>in</em> my 30s. Suddenly miserable, I knocked back the last of my sauvignon blanc and excused myself. I have no desire to pass for 25, or even 30. But jeez, I don't want to look <em>over</em> my age either. And as a longtime beauty writer, I shouldn't: Sunscreen is my BFF (I wear broad-spectrum SPF 30 every day), and I feel naked if I go to bed without slathering on my retinol serum and peptide-packed cream. Still, I have a few forehead creases that simply won't budge. I'd long suspected that they made me appear older--and now I had the proof, albeit from a tipsy stranger with no filter. Should I simply accept my lines, or tackle them with a new battle plan?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Many women are asking the same question, and they're finding answers at the business end of a needle. Injectables are easily the most popular cosmetic procedures in the country. More than 2.6 million people got Botox last year, up 7 percent from 2010. Hyaluronic-acid fillers are the second most requested, at 1.2 million last year. Meanwhile, many cosmetic surgical procedures (as in face-lifts) and non surgical ones (things like chemical peels and laser hair removal) are either flat or down. So who's fueling the surge? Women like me: married, working moms who, according to the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, want to look \"more relaxed.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>These cosmetic-lite measures have obvious appeal: They take off a reasonable number of years in minutes, they cost far less than cosmetic surgery, and they require virtually no downtime. To me, however, they're still a big financial commitment, and I already spend enough on my beauty upkeep. (I could probably list my hair colorist as a dependent on my tax return.) But perhaps my biggest fear is this: Could that first shot be some sort of gateway drug? I can imagine the infomercial: <em>People who bought Botox for crow's-feet... also enjoyed cheek and lip fillers.</em> \"We've all seen the overdone women--the blown-up lips, the oddly shaped cheeks, the frozen faces,\" says D'Anne Kleinsmith, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in Bloomfield, MI. \"Many women fear that these unnatural-looking results are the norm, but they're not.\" Okay, but what exactly <em>is</em> the norm, and are the results worth it? To find out, I cross-examined top board-certified doctors from around the country, talked to scores of women who've had the procedures, and got my hands on every study I could find about the satisfaction rates. So if you, like me, are a sane, slightly vain woman who's wondered about going under the needle, this is your deep-dive guide to injectables.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong><em>How do injectables work?</em></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>There are dozens of space-age-sounding names for injectables, but they basically boil down to two types. Neurotoxins (i.e., Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin) block nerve impulses so facial muscles relax and stop contracting, no longer causing creases. Dermal fillers (including hyaluronic acids like Restylane and calcium-based fillers such as Radiesse) treat deeper wrinkles and folds as well as sagging, which happens when you lose collagen under the skin. Some can also plump lips and restore fullness to the face. \"Women who use injectables tend to start with muscle relaxers to soften fine lines in their 30s, and move on to fillers in their 40s or 50s, if needed,\" says Ken Beer, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in West Palm Beach, FL.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When and if you start also depends on the kind of wrinkles you have. Lines that make you look permanently sad, tired, or annoyed may truly merit an injectable intervention. \"I looked like Donald Trump, always scowling,\" says Sandra Kircher*, a 44-year-old businesswoman in Hillsborough, NJ, who now gets Botox between her brows. \"The lines just kept getting deeper, even though I wear sunscreen every day and use rich moisturizers.\" But there are good wrinkles too. \"Crow's-feet are smile lines and are connected with happiness and warm feelings,\" says Dee A. Glaser, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in St. Louis. \"Why would you want to erase them?\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Like most anti-aging treatments, it helps to start injections on \"bad\" lines sooner rather than later, because the less engraved they are, the fewer treatments you'll need. Even if you've gotten injections in the past and decided to stop, you'll most likely be in a better place than where you began, says Paul M. Friedman, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in Houston. That's because fillers help skin regenerate natural collagen, \"and neurotoxins like Botox help retrain your muscles so they don't crease as much.\" Elizabeth Tanzi, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in Washington, DC, concurs: \"A woman with fine lines could try what I call 'baby Botox.' It's a smaller dosage of the toxin that prevents wrinkles from etching, while still allowing for plenty of facial movement.\" In fact, Kleinsmith says she's seen patients with fine lines who only needed one round of Botox, no repeats. \"But they're typically in their early 30s,\" she admits. Christina Lowden, a 42-year-old yoga instructor in Trinity, FL, missed that window. \"At 40, I got Botox to smooth my brow lines, but by then they were too deep for it to really work,\" she says. Though the Botox, which she still gets, helped stop new wrinkles from forming, Lowden ended up getting Restylane to fill in the old ones.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When you add it up, these procedures are an investment. (For prices, see the chart at right.) Some good news for your wallet, though: Injectables have dropped in price thanks to increased competition from newer brands. And many of the women I spoke with said they're able to eke out more mileage from each injection, because their results last longer than expected. (To find out how long most injectables last, see the chart.) \"I only go for Botox twice a year--sometimes I can push it to every seven months,\" says Kircher. And Lowden says her Restylane has lasted well over a year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>&#160;</h3>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-10-04T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1651127","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/ba/rbk-botox-injections-1012-3-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"O'Rourke","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11761827","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

I love to grow them in shallow pots on the garden table and then transfer them indoors as a centrepiece<br />when in full bloom. Beautiful Oriental hyacinth &#8216;Carnegie&#8217; offers gorgeous pure-white blooms, while &#8216;City of Haarlem&#8217; has soft, primrose-yellow flowers. While &#8216;Hollyhock&#8217; is extra special because of its double red-pink blooms. A classic variety, orientalis &#8216;Peter Stuyvesant&#8217; bears rich, deep violet-blue blooms that contrast beautifully against lighter-coloured flowers. All smell great. Also scentsational&#8230;<strong><br />Tulips</strong>: &#8216;Prinses Irene&#8217;, bold orange colour of T &#8216;Ballerina&#8217;, darkest red &#8216;Couleur Cardinal&#8217; (dark red with purple-blue flaming) and blush-pink semi-double &#8216;Ang&#233;lique&#8217; with its peony-like blooms.<strong><br />Daffodil</strong>s: &#8216;Thalia&#8217; is exquisitely fragrant, while &#8216;Actaea&#8217; offers a spicy scent dating back to the 1920s.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>'How do you grow bluebells?' <em><br /></em></strong><em>Belinda Harris, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs</em><br />Bluebells thrive on the loamy, leaf mould-type soil of a woodland environment, so the more trees you have in your garden, the better. Alternatively, you can always apply finely composted bark-chip mulch to areas of bluebells. Plant your bulbs in the autumn, about 10-15cm (approx 4-6in) deep and about 9cm (3.5in) apart, taking care to water well when they are in flower, as they like a moist soil. <br /><strong>Perfect companion</strong>&#8230; Ferns look wonderful grown with bluebells.</p>\n<p><strong>'Which way around do I plant bulbs &#8211; point up or down? I can never remember.'</strong><em><br />Margaret Peters, Kirkby</em>, <em>Lonsdale, Cumbria</em><br />Plant your bulbs with the flat side down, and the pointy end up. If this isn&#8217;t obvious, plant the bulb on its side &#8211; the foliage and stems will find their own way up.</p>\n<p><strong>'How deep should bulbs be planted?'</strong><em><br />Keeley Dwyer, Liverpool</em><strong><br /></strong>Depth depends on the bulb type, but a general rule is to plant them at about three to six times the height of the bulb. If you&#8217;re not sure, always check the packaging.</p>\n<p><strong>'Should I deadhead my bulbs like other garden owers?'</strong><em><br />Alison Beaumont, Worcester</em><br />Definitely. They won&#8217;t produce more bloom, but the energy used in producing seed is better retained in the bulb to provide a good display next year. Ideally, cut the flower stem (not the leaves) back to the base, or nip off the flower head.</p>\n<p><strong>'Once my daffs and hyacinths have flowered, what do I do to make sure they flower again next year? They are in pots on my terrace.'<br /></strong><em>Amanda Taylor, Eastbourne, East Sussex<strong><br /></strong></em>There&#8217;s no doubt that new bulbs planted annually give the best display, but if given plenty of plant food and water, many bulbs will continue to give a good show for several years. If you&#8217;d like a new display next year, add them to flowerbeds and borders once they&#8217;ve finished blooming.</p>\n<p><strong>'Can you suggest what bulbs to plant for a succession of blooms during spring and early summer?'</strong> <em><br />Pamela Worthington, Didsbury, Manchester</em><br />My favourite bulbs to provide early flowers in the year include daffodils &#8216;T&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te&#8217;, &#8216;Thalia&#8217; and &#8216;Hawera&#8217;, the larger-flowering blooms of crocus tommasinianus, and my favourite snowdrop Galanthus nivalis &#8216;Flore Pleno&#8217;, followed by a feast of tulips. I have hundreds of Tulipa &#8216;Havran&#8217; mixed with T. &#8216;Prinses Irene&#8217; and T. &#8216;Ballerina&#8217; in pots and borders. And for early summer, I wouldn&#8217;t be without the bold allium &#8216;Purple Sensation&#8217; in my garden.</p>\n<p><strong>'I find the wind often breaks the stems of my tulips. Would it be better to grow them in tight clumps, or are some varieties sturdier than others?'</strong><em><br />Barbara Roberts, Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire</em><br />A few well-hidden, short bamboo canes and a loop of twine can do wonders. And choose tulip varieties with shorter stems, including the Kaufmanniana and Greigii hybrids, whose large-flowered and short-stemmed blooms come in a spectacular range of bold colours. They are perfect for container cultivation and include large fiery red flowers of Tulipa &#8216;Double Red Riding Hood&#8217;, unusual orange-and-red T. &#8216;Early Harvest&#8217; and warm-yellow, striped-scarlet-red T. &#8216;Stresa&#8217;.</p>\n<p><strong>'How do I get best results from growing bulbs in containers?</strong>'<br /><em>Sameena Begum, Dewsbury, West Yorks</em><br />Plant bulbs densely, without touching, much closer than you would in a border. And plant in layers, one variety above another, to create a succession of blooms and along show of flowers. Feed regularly, water well, and place containers out of the way of drying, toppling winds.</p>\n<p><strong>'Why do my daffodils produce lots of leaves, but no flowers?'</strong> <br /><em>Senga McDowell, Ayr</em><br />Commonly known as &#8216;blindness&#8217;, this happens when bulbs have become overcrowded and unfed after a few years in the ground &#8211; they&#8217;re healthy, but haven&#8217;t got enough energy to produce flowers. Lift and divide congested clumps and replant them into prepared ground. Keep them well fed and watered. Sometimes a pest or disease is the cause, but in that case the foliage would be affected, too.</p>\n<p><strong>'What spring bulbs flower best in shade?'</strong><br /><em>Gillian Bean, Dorchester, Dorset</em><br />Bluebells, wood anemones and Lent lily (wild daffodils) are all woodlanders, so reproduce conditions they thrive in. Dig over the soil, adding compost, leaf mould or fine composted bark, then plant carpets of blue Anemone blanda, golden Eranthis hyemalis, marbled Cyclamen hederifolium, massed snowdrops (such as Galanthus &#8216;S Arnott&#8217; or &#8216;Magnet&#8217;), daffodils and fritillaria meleagris (right), or crocuses, such as lilac C. tommasinianus.</p>\n<p><strong>'What should I do to daffodil bulbs once the flowers have bloomed in spring, leaving wilted leaves?'</strong><em><br />Kim Taylor, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire</em><br />Don&#8217;t be tempted to cull spent daffodils for at least six weeks after flowering &#8211; the dying leaves help provide food stores for next year&#8217;s bulbs. Try planting perennials too, which will flower once the daffodils have finished. Favourite plants include Hemerocallis &#8216;Stafford&#8217;, Nepeta &#8216;Six Hills Giant&#8217; and Paeonia &#8216;Buckeye Belle&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/grow-summer-bulbs\" target=\"_blank\">Summer-flowering bulbs to plant in spring</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/%20http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/plant-autumn-flowering-bulbs\" target=\"_blank\">Autumn-flowering bulbs to plant in summer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/plant-spring-flowering-bulbs\" target=\"_blank\">Spring-flowering bulbs to plant in autumn</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/plant-winter-flowering-bulbs\" target=\"_blank\">Winter-flowering bulbs to plant in autumn</a></p>\n<p>Find more <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/?cmpid=craftnav\" target=\"_blank\">gardening ideas</a> here</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-10-02T14:10:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"1","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"5.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"12009130","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-10-03T07:07:33.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-24T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/craft/garden-ideas/beautiful-bulbs-questions-and-answers","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"It's not just for cooking...","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Six surprising uses for garlic","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-09-19T12:55:19.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"641","teaser":"It's not just for cooking...","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"From boosting your love life to preventing insect bites, there are numerous of uses for those little cloves of garlic","pagination_thumb":null,"description":null,"url_name":"garlic-for-health","page_number":1,"creation_date":"2012-08-23T16:21:32.000Z","title":"Six surprising uses for garlic","custom_canonical":null,"meta_title":"Six suprising uses for garlic","allow_comment":"1","author":{"organization_id":"505","active":"Y","site_id":"601","nick_name":null,"last_updated_by":"sragan","last_name":"Unknown","email":null,"creation_date":"2011-02-22T14:18:55.000Z","id":"11239","last_updated_date":"2011-02-22T14:18:55.000Z","title":null,"first_name":"Unknown"},"contributor_email":null,"import_section_id":null,"body":"<h3>To boost your love life</h3>\n<p>&#8216;Most would imagine garlic to be a hindrance to their romantic endeavours but &#8211; overcoming the minor issue of bad breath &#8211; garlic can act as an aphrodisiac,&#8217; says Natasha Edwards, author of <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780857830609\" target=\"_blank\">'Garlic: The Mighty Bulb'</a> (Kyle Books, &#163;14.99). &#8216;It&#8217;s down to garlic&#8217;s ability to enhance the flow of blood. It improves circulation, and this can reach to all parts of the body &#8211; the effect is immediate!&#8217;</p>\n<h3>For natural pest control</h3>\n<p>&#8216;Garlic is extremely interesting to work with in the garden,&#8217; says <a href=\"http://www.pippagreenwood.com\">Pippa Greenwood</a>, BBC Radio 4&#8217;s Gardeners&#8217; Question Time panellist. &#8216;Carrots attract a certain kind of fly, but you can deter them by planting alternate rows of carrots and garlic. Many gardeners have also told me that a solution of garlic and water works well to get rid of pests, as the odour masks the smell of the plant they&#8217;re likely to eat.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>To prevent insect bites</h3>\n<p>Historically, people used garlic to bring relief from bites, but prevention is better than cure. &#8216;The sulphur compounds released from your pores after you eat garlic will help repel biting insects,&#8217; says Natasha. &#8216;Or apply garlic crushed into petroleum jelly direct to the skin, as a natural repellent.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>To help with back pain</h3>\n<p>Natural-living expert <a href=\"http://www.imperfectlynatural.com\" target=\"_blank\">Janey Lee Grace</a> swears by garlic as an eco health essential: &#8216;It&#8217;s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, which means it&#8217;s great for easing back pain,&#8217; she says. &#8216;Fry around ten cloves of garlic in organic virgin coconut oil. Cool, then massage into the lower back. Its healing properties work wonders!&#8217;</p>\n<h3>As a green cleaner</h3>\n<p>&#8216;For a natural disinfectant,&#8217; says eco-enthusiast <a href=\"http://www.lyndseyyoung.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Lyndsey Young</a>, &#8216;mix a few chopped garlic cloves with white vinegar and a few drops of lemon oil. Garlic is naturally antibacterial, so it helps fight mould and germs.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>As a health cure-all</h3>\n<p>&#8216;The benefits of garlic are astonishing,&#8217; says Chris Burley, president of the General Council and Register of Naturopaths. &#8216;One large clove provides about 12,000mg of allicin &#8211; the equivalent of a dose of penicillin! It helps regulate blood sugar, improves blood clots and can lower blood pressure. It&#8217;s also an anti-oxidant and excellent for long-term immunity. Many people feel the difference simply by introducing two cloves a day, or drinking garlic tea.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a

classic dish from the Gascony region of France evokes harvest time, when hunting season is in full swing, root vegetables begin to appear at the farmers' markets, and the grapes in the wine region are picked at their sweet peak.</p>\n\n<p>Quail, if you haven't cooked them before, are small, plump, very flavorful birds, now commonly found at good supermarkets. I like to saut&#233; the birds first, to caramelize the skin, and then finish them in the oven. They're served on a bed of saut&#233;ed radishes and turnips, whose slight bitterness goes beautifully with the sweetness of a sauce made from green grapes. Cr&#232;me fra&#238;che gives the sauce its rich smoothness, and a dash of cognac, which, of course, is also made from grapes, adds a fragrant, French flavor.</p>\n\n<p>I typically prepare this for an autumn dinner party, serving each guest two quail &#151; because this dish is so good, you can't help but eat two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What to Drink</strong></p>\n\n<p>Daniel Johnnes, wine director of Daniel Boulud's <a href=\"http://www.danielnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">restaurants</a>, recommends accompanying this elegant dish with Delamotte Blanc de Blancs Brut NV ($57), a Chardonnay-based Champagne. \"It's delicate enough to support the subtlety of the quail and grapes, yet it's rich and creamy, complementing the butter and cr&#232;me fra&#238;che sauce.\" An alternative is Gruet Brut NV ($13), a fresh, crisp sparkling wine from New Mexico. \"It has richness and a depth of flavor as a result of long aging before bottling,\" he says.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a

Domino's...</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ORDER: Thin Crust With Veggies and Light Cheese.</strong> This skinny thin-crust slice--with lots of black olives, green peppers, spinach, and mushrooms--clocks in at only 245 calories per large slice. But if you want to customize, log on to Domino's online nutritional calculator, the Cal-O-Meter, and virtually build the pizza of your dreams.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>SKIP: Cali Chicken Bacon Ranch on Hand-Tossed Crust.</strong> A single slice packs 430 calories. I'm guessing the vaguely named \"white sauce\" is the calorie culprit here.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>At Papa John's...</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ORDER: Garden Fresh on Thin Crust.</strong> This pie is a veggie lover's dream, with onions, green peppers, and portabella mushrooms. A large slice has a reasonable calorie count (220), which you can shave down further if you ask them to go easy on the cheese.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>SKIP: John's Favorite Pizza for One.</strong> You might think it sounds like a perfect individual portion--but think again! This pizza has a mind-blowing 1,080 calories and 56 grams of fat. Papa John, please find a <em>new</em> favorite.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>At Pizza Hut...</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ORDER: Thin 'N Crispy Ham &amp; Pineapple.</strong> Carnivores will love this sweet-salty combo, and everyone can appreciate its 240 calories. To save some fat grams, blot the top with a napkin before you chow down.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>SKIP: Stuffed Crust Meat Lover's.</strong> One large slice packs an ugly 480 calories, thanks to fatty meat toppings and a crust stuffed with cheese. Even more lethal: the 720-calorie Dan's Original Personal Pan Pizza. The \"individual\" (yeah, right) pie strikes again.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>At California Pizza Kitchen...</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>ORDER: Roasted Artichoke + Spinach on Thin Crust.</strong> Thin crust is usually a safe bet, but you'll get into trouble if you eat this entire pie--it has 955 calories. So split it with a few pals and fill out your meal with a salad.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>SKIP: California Club.</strong> This relatively small pie has a whopping 1,401 calories. Even if you share it with two friends, that's still 467 calories a person!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong>PERFECT FROZEN PIES. <em>THAT'S</em> AMORE.</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>There are lots of pizza options in the freezer aisle, but diet-friendly? Only a few. If you're dining solo, snag a single-serving pie. I love Amy's Light &amp; Lean, as well as the kinds by Lean Cuisine and Weight Watchers Smart Ones. If you've got a crowd, slice up a thin-crust pizza from Kashi or Newman's Own. Stick to those with 240 to 280 calories and 10 grams of fat or less per serving.

He's not even your ordinary make-a-fuss type. A documentary filmmaker who gets his fill of tense situations all over the world, he's always telling me, the hothead, \"Let it go.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But on this night four years ago, I was nine months pregnant and feeling sick. I had been waiting for a man with a small dog to exit the cab when a woman hopped in from the other side. Everyone--first me, then my husband, then the man with the small dog--explained that I'd been waiting. She shrugged. We pointed out my pregnancy, in case she was blind in both eyes or just thought I was overweight in a way that looked exactly like being pregnant. She said she didn't care. That's what set him off. It was as if a pressurized chamber in his brain--one that had remained sealed through a decade of New York City's bad subway commutes and mouthy masses-- finally blew. He cursed. He told her she was selfish and pathetic. There was even something that sounded like growling.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The woman refused to leave, and we took the subway home. But I didn't feel as sick anymore. In fact, I was giddy. My husband, from whom I'd never seen even a flash of fury, had gotten angry in public. I had no idea he could do that! What else could he do? Rescue puppies from burning buildings? Stop criminals with his laser eyes? <em>The laundry?</em> For weeks afterward, I was filled with weird, choked-up longing whenever I saw him. I rubbed my belly and thought, <em>Kid, you have no idea who your father is</em>, as if I'd somehow spawned with a superhero.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Here's the thing about settling into long-term love: It's a little sad that you've passed the \"can't wait to see you tonight\" stage, but you've also made it through the \"struggling with the newness of this thing\" stage. Your 22-year-old self would be shocked by how much you've come to prize simple reliability in your relationship. But sometimes the butterflies still show up at the weirdest moments, cutting your breath short and reminding you why you chose your partner in the first place--or, even more exciting, giving you a new reason to love him. For Anna Block, it happened most recently when she and her husband of five years were cleaning up after dinner: \"We were talking about something banal when he turned to me and said, 'You really are my best friend.' And then I just felt this rush.\" Says PR executive Jennifer Foley Shields, \"When my daughter was moving from the infant room to the toddler room at day care, I caught my husband giving her a pep talk at breakfast. He explained that some of her friends who had moved earlier might not seem as friendly at first. 'But you'll learn the ropes,' he told her. It was so sweet--and so unexpectedly attractive.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>While conventional wisdom tells us that these pulse-racing moments are trivial little extras in the grand scheme of things, it turns out they're actually critical to a happy relationship. \"Most research on long-term relationships has focused on conflict,\" says Terri Orbuch, Ph.D., the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Steps-Take-Marriage-Great/dp/0385342861/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1348801832&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=5+Simple+Steps+to+Take+Your+Marriage+From+Good+to+Great++Read+more%3A+Get+Ready+to+Crush+on+your+Husband+-+Redbook\" target=\"_blank\"><em>5 Simple Steps to Take Your Marriage From Good to Great</em></a>. \"But studies suggest that boredom may have just as big an impact on happiness over time.\" Orbuch and a team of researchers did a 16-year study on 123 couples who were married in the same year. Couples who reported being bored at year seven were more likely to be unsatisfied by the end of the study than the couples who'd had similar levels of conflict but low boredom.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>So what can you do if you think the crush is completely gone? Experts and regular ol' partnered-and-happy people have lots of advice on how to bring on a hot spell. First, simply try seeing your husband through other people's eyes, says publishing exec Jennie Tung. She's been married for eight years, and says discovering that her husband's coworkers think he's a rock star triggered a Belieber-caliber infatuation. \"After a year at a new job, he told me he was happy with the annual review his coworkers had given him, so I asked to read it,\" Jennie says. \"As I pored over the seven-page document describing him as a brilliant businessman, a person with 'intelligence, integrity, and grace,' I was blown away. While we'd been muddling through the day-to-day minutiae, he'd been quietly kicking ass at work. Seeing him in this new light put me a bit in awe of him, and it's lasted.\" Sadly, most of us don't get a written report of our husband's virtues, but the next time your friend says, \"You're so lucky to have a guy like him,\" really take in her reasons, and celebrate them.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-28T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1639227","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/LQ/rbk-crush-on-husband-1012-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"kfillig","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11761811","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

We got to the bottom of the liquid diet mania:</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>To juice or to blend? </strong>If you're new to the lingo, here's a tip: Smoothies and juices are very different animals. A smoothie serves up whole fruits and vegetables, pulverized and sucked through a straw. Juice is made by separating the liquid and most of the nutrients from the pulp, which is then tossed. Die-hard juicers say getting rid of the pulp speeds vitamin delivery to your body, but \"there's no evidence to support that claim,\" says Melina Jampolis, M.D., an internist specializing in nutrition. Plus, pulp has cancer-fighting, weight-maintaining fiber. Her opinion: Fresh juice can be great, but a pure fruit-and-veggie smoothie (minus add-ins like fro-yo) is even better.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Why not just eat whole fruits and vegetables? </strong>By all means, do, if you're willing to chew through eight daily servings. If that's not happening, a beverage can be a convenient shortcut. You can squeeze several servings of fruits and vegetables into one glass, says registered dietitian Wendy Dickerman, clinical nutrition manager at Mercy Suburban Hospital in East Norriton, PA.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Is juicing a magic weight-loss bullet?</strong> In a word: no. It's a quick way to load up on disease-battling, anti-aging antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins, but it could actually cause weight gain, not loss. \"Liquid calories don't register fullness like solid calories,\" says Jampolis, so you may consume more calories overall because your body doesn't realize how many you've sipped. (One 12-ounce glass of fresh-pressed apples, for instance, has close to 200 calories.) Have juice <em>instead</em> of a snack or light meal, not with it.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>What's a juice \"cleanse\"--and should we all really do one?</strong> Some detox plans require replacing one meal a day with juice; others allow only fresh-squeezed juices and zero chewable food. The goal is to remove toxins from the body, and help you shed pounds and gain energy, but doctors and dietitians point out that your liver and kidneys \"detox\" your body every day, and no studies have shown that juice helps the process along. Also, if you reduce your calories too much--to less than 1,200 a day for most women--your body can begin to burn lean muscle, which is bad for your strength and your metabolism. Think of juicing as a health supplement rather than a weight-loss tool, says Jampolis: \"Stick with brightly colored fruits and vegetables that you really struggle to get into your diet, like kale and spinach, and make sure that you're still getting 25 grams of fiber a day.\" And remember that fruit has a higher sugar content than vegetables, so when you do hit the juice bar, go heavy on the veggie blends.</p>\n<h3>&#160;</h3>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-27T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1637147","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/xW/rbk-juicing-trend-1012-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Stephens","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11761825","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/health-wellness/best-delivery-diets\">Delivery Diets That Deliver Results</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/reset-diets\">Are Reset Diets the New Cleanses?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/losing-weight/rlhl-counting-calories\">\"I said good-bye to fad diets and started counting calories.\"</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/diet-pills-yl\">Do Diet Pills Really Work ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/health/bloating-remedies\">9 Foods to Beat the Bloat, Plus 9 Foods to Avoid</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/fitness-weight-loss/weight-loss-pills\">Weight Loss Pills: How Much Do Diet Drugs Help?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/10-tips-for-avoiding-weekend-weight-gain-449574\">10 Tips for Avoiding Weekend Weight Gain</a><br>\n<a href=\"/health-wellness/advice/lose-weight-fast-how-to-do-it-safely-441786\">Lose Weight Fast: How to Do It Safely</a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty-fashion/anti-aging-skin-secrets\">Skin Secrets of Women Who Look This Good</a><br>\n<a href=\"/recipes-home/healthy-summer-entertaining\">15 Stay-Slim Summer Entertaining Secrets</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"headline_image_id":"1637146","print_issue_date":"2012-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T15:31:00.000Z","author_id":"37710","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"redbook","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Redbook","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.redbookmag.com/health-wellness/advice/juice-diet-facts","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Shop Bazaar's picks for the best shoes and accessories for fall.","site_id":"17","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.harpersbazaar.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"crutherford","keywords":"trend spotting, the extras, space oddity","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"The Extras: Space Oddity","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-09-27T14:35:25.000Z","related_links_list":[{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/embellished-shoes-purses-jewelry-0912","link_text":"The Extras : Space Oddity"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/red-and-pink-shoes-purses-jewelry-0912","link_text":"The Extras : Hot Tropic"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/fall-shoes-purses-jewelry-2012","link_text":"The Extras : Fall 2012 Accessories Report"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/summer-metallics-shoes-accessories-0612","link_text":"The Extras : Heavy Metal and Wine Time"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/black-and-white-shoes-purses-jewelry-0912","link_text":"The Extras : Contrast Ratio"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/brown-and-blush-accessories-0812","link_text":"The Extras : Natural Beauties and In The Buff"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/summer-accessories-and-shoes-0512","link_text":"The Extras : Gar&Atilde;&sect;onne Chic and Golden State"},{"auto_generated":"1","syndication_flag":"0","protected":"0","url":"/fashion/springs-best-shoes-and-bags-0412","link_text":"The Extras : Going Green &amp;

Help!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE PLASTIC SURGEON SAYS:</strong> \"To treat a fresh wound, clean it with mild soap and water. Don't use hydrogen peroxide or any treatment containing alcohol--both kill bacteria, but they also zap the healthy cells that repair skin, which makes you more likely to scar. Also, never apply vitamin E to an open cut--it slows healing.\" Instead, use a medicated ointment such as Neosporin or Bacitracin, then slap on a Band-Aid. \"Do this for four or five days, until the cut seals over.\" Once a scab forms, bring out the vitamin E. \"At night, squeeze on a capsule's worth and massage it in. This stimulates blood flow to speed up healing, and studies suggest it may also help skin grow back more evenly.\" Keep this up for about three months, then be patient. \"It can take a year for any raised or discolored skin to disappear. If that doesn't happen, a dermatologist can shrink a thick, puffy scar with a steroid injection for about $250.\"</p>\n<p><strong>--Anthony LaBruna, M.D., a clinical associate professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE DERMATOLOGIST SAYS:</strong> \"If the cut is on your face or neck, don't use any skin-care products containing retinoids, such as retinol and Retin-A, or any exfoliants until it's healed. And regardless of where your scab is, don't scrub or pick at it, which can leave a scar.\" Let it fall off naturally, then treat the skin with ScarAway Silicone Scar Sheets, $19.99 for 8, or, for your face, ScarAway Scar Diminishing Serum (below), $17.99. \"Both contain a silicone that hydrates and repairs scar tissue, which, in turn, softens and fades the mark; they also help relieve itching. If you have medium or dark skin, be sure to also protect the area from the sun, which can make discoloration worse.\" If at any point your cut swells, crusts, or starts to ooze, see your doctor. \"When left untreated, infected cuts are more prone to scarring.\"</p>\n<p><strong>--Jeffrey Dover, M.D., an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, CT</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE MAKEUP ARTIST SAYS:</strong> \"To hide a cut on your face, neck, or chest, wait until it scabs or closes up before putting makeup on it (otherwise it can get infected). Once that happens, you'll need a thick, full-coverage concealer, which typically comes in a stick or pot, to help cover it.\" (Try Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer, right, $23.) First, find the closest match to your skin tone, then fine-tune. \"If the cut is red around the edges, pick a yellow-y concealer to counteract the redness. If it's more brown, go with a peachy color.\" Then, to camouflage the scab, use a tiny concealer brush to carefully dab just around the edges. \"On the top, dust a tinted loose powder to take down the discoloration.\"</p>\n<p><strong>--Fatima Thomas, a senior makeup artist for MAC Cosmetics who has worked with Alicia Keys and Mary J.

What do I mean? Oh don&#146;t come so coy with me, Missy.&#160; I&#146;ve seen you, going in their shops, touching their merchandise, meeting the nice salesperson, asking their advice, taking up their time. And then what? Well, then you go home and order exactly the same thing cheaper online. You&#146;re a shop flirt. And I should know, because I&#146;m one too.</p>\n<p>But the last couple of things I&#146;ve bought have taught me a bit of a lesson. Of course it&#146;s nice to know that you&#146;ve saved a bit of money, but sometimes, quite apart from feeling a bit dirty, Shop flirting can be a FALSE ECONOMY. Yes! You might end up losing money! And here&#146;s why...</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don&#146;t believe the headlines.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#146;s easy to get transfixed by a headline price. Especially if it&#146;s a number that looks substantially smaller than the one on the fridge you just saw. But online prices always exclude delivery, which you will always have to pay. Fine if you&#146;re buying socks, but if you&#146;re buying a heavy item, it&#146;s not unusual for the shipping costs to push the price way over the sticker price in the shop. But by that stage, you&#146;re on the payment page anyway so&#133;.oh go on then! You shop flirt, you! Classic example &#150; the dishwasher I bought online recently actually ended up saving me just &#163;20 over the in-store price. What was the point?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your flexible friend.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clearance sales online are rubbish, generally. Yes, you might get lucky with a discount code that you couldn&#146;t use in a bricks and mortar shop, but when it comes down to individual items at proper knock-down prices you&#146;ll never beat the shop floor. Example &#150; I had to buy some sports equipment last week. After checking online I got the best price I could from someone I&#146;d never met. Then I called up my mate who runs my local sports shop &#150; he had a few left which he wanted to get rid of. HALF THE PRICE!&#160;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Service still counts.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A face-to-face purchase can come with added value. What isn&#146;t stated on the receipt that there is, to a greater or lesser extent, a social contract between you and a shopkeeper which can go beyond your legal rights. He or she knows that their reputation is at stake with every sale they make, and particularly for local retailers who rely on word-of-mouth advertising, that can count for a lot in your favour. As an example: twenty years on, my Mum still talks in glowing terms about the butcher who sent a turkey 40 miles in a taxi to make sure it got&#160; to us by Christmas Eve. Your online equivalent? Well, you can praise someone on a forum or website, but it doesn&#146;t have the same effect. And online retailers know that.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>And finally&#133;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have you ever tried returning something substantial to an online retailer? The days off work waiting for a courier, the endless phoning while your life drips away &#133; all of it can make you wish for a nice warm shop.</p>\n<p>We all know the advantages of shopping online. Price, choice, availability, convenience. But sometimes you can&#146;t beat a bit of face to face interaction. Always remember, shops can offer things that the internet simply can&#146;t.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Allwright is a presenter on BBC One's Rogue Traders and a columnist in Best magazine, published weekly.

Put an old aircraft engine in a car and it's even better.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nEarly-20th-century plane engines were simply bigger and better-constructed versions of automotive powerplants. All the moving parts were machined to aircraft standards, which were much higher than a car's for obvious reasons. They had redundant features, such as two ignition systems, in case one didn't work. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nAfter World War I, a small group of speed enthusiasts started putting surplus warplane engines in big and sturdy car frames. It was a tremendous feat of engineering. With that giant engine in the car, you were basically flying on the ground. Racing aircraft-engine cars became especially popular at the Brooklands circuit in England. It was one of the first banked oval tracks and perfect for powerful cars with little to no braking. Count Louis Zborowski's four Chitty Bang Bang specials were the most famous examples. The origin of the odd name is disputed, but the cars became renowned, inspiring the similarly named children's book and later the movie.   \n\n<br /><br />\n\nI have four cars with aircraft engines. Three of the engines are from World War I, and one is from World War II. My newest car is a 1917 Fiat called the Botafogo Special. It was built by an Argentine racer named Adolfo Scandroglio. He was an admirer of Sir Ernest Eldridge, who owned the legendary, record-setting Fiat Mephistopheles racer that went 146 mph in 1924 on a public road in France. Scandroglio built this car as a copy and named it after the racehorse Botafogo, Argentina's Secretariat.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Botafogo Special's World War I 21.7-liter Fiat A.12 engine was used in more than a dozen kinds of Italian airplanes. It has six huge cylinders with four valves each, overhead cams, twin magnetos, and a dry sump&#151;pretty modern, considering it was designed in 1912. Each piston's displacement is bigger than that of a 3-liter engine. It barely makes 320 hp at 1800 rpm, but all that torque just wafts you along. At 60 mph you're using only 800 rpm. The heat the engine puts out is incredible. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Botafogo originally didn't have brakes or a transmission. I have no idea how the car stopped, but that didn't prevent Scandroglio from racing it. An old photo I have shows a big vertical hook on the front. When the car went off the road, the hook was supposed to prevent injury by catching any of the barbed-wire fencing common throughout the Argentine countryside. Sadly, Scandroglio was killed while racing this car in 1949. Then the Botafogo disappeared. Luckily, the engine was found in the 1990s by the guys at Pur Sang, an Argentine company that builds exact replicas of Bugatti Type 35s and Alfa Romeo 8C 2300s. They reconstructed the car and added an old Mercedes-Benz four-speed transmission and two rear-wheel drum brakes. I bought it from them last year.  \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Botafogo can probably go 146 mph, so it also has a modern horn now. With only two brakes, the car doesn't stop fast, and you want to warn people to get out of the way. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nBefore heading out, some predriving maintenance is necessary. It's part of the romance of these old aircraft engines. With its exposed valve gear, you don't want to start up anything dry, so you give the valves and rockers a few squirts of oil. Then you pump up the fuel pressure by hand using a big lever in the cockpit. Next you pump, or \"tickle,\" the carbs to open the floats and let in more gas. Finally, off you go.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nOn the road, it's as if you're actually taxiing in a World War I airplane. It's great fun. You feel like you ought to be strafing other cars as you go down the highway. Redline is 1800 rpm, so the engine pulls 300 or 400 rpm with incredible stump-pulling torque&#151;<i>tic-tic-TIK-TIK-TIKA-TIKA-VROOOMMMM!</i>\n\n<br /><br />\n\nA huge chain drives each rear wheel, so you have to remember not to drop your hand over the side of the cockpit. I love the raw mechanicalness of old chain-drive cars. It's like you're Marley's ghost, with those exposed chains clattering. People stand on the street and just stare. When you drive a noisy, smoking monster car, you quickly realize how far we've come with modern vehicles. \n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe Botafogo isn't the best car for L.A.; low speeds on the city's typically congested streets result in a carbon buildup in the combustion chambers that causes the plugs to \"load up,\" or fire intermittently. But get it out on the open road, put your foot down, and it's fantastic. There's no modern equivalent, not even a Hemi. \n\n<br /><br />","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-24T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Leno","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"cjdavis","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11992701","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/cars/4339713\">Why Jay Leno's Excited to See New Fiats in America</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/jay-leno/4234113\">Jay Leno's Eco-Friendly Custom Bike: Green Garage , Part 8</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/jay-leno/technology/2155722\">Jay Leno's Garage - For The Record</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/jay-lenos-green-garage-intro-video-428944474\">Jay Leno's Green Garage intro Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/jay-lenos-green-garage-bio-circle-parts-washer-video-604282405\">Jay Leno's Green Garage : Bio Circle Parts Washer Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/jay-lenos-green-garage-hybrid-water-heaters-video-1126042400\">Jay Leno's Green Garage : Hybrid Water Heaters Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/the-1917-fiat-botafogo-special-and-its-wwi-aircraft-engine-11992701\">The 1917 Fiat Botafogo Special&mdash;And its WWI Aircraft Engine</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/jay-lenos-green-garage-wind-turbines-video-1077019761\">Jay Leno's Green Garage : Wind Turbines Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/jay-lenos-green-garage-custom-bike-video-1325126963\">Jay Leno's Green Garage : Custom Bike Video</a><br>\n<a href=\"/cars/jay-leno/technology/4213287\">Jay Leno's Green Garage : Bio-Circle Parts Cleaner (with Video)</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-08T12:28:47.000Z","author_id":"8941","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"popularmechanics","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"Popular Mechanics","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/jay-leno/vintage/the-1917-fiat-botafogo-special-and-its-wwi-aircraft-engine-11992701","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Find them on this small screen too...","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":null,"keywords":"hysteria, buy vibrators online, Hysteria film, sex toys, vibrators, buy sex toys online, pelvic massage","rate":"5.00","promo_title":"Hysteria: vibrators hit the big screen","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-09-25T09:46:26.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Adrienne","source_id":"641","teaser":"Find them on this small screen too...","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"Find them on this small screen too...","pagination_thumb":null,"description":"Hysteria: bringing vibrators to the big screen: sex toys to buy, on allaboutyou.com &#150; also the online home of Prima, Best, Country Living and House Beautiful.

I've also always loved Disneyland and the idea of a world that's all fantasy. Combine that with my mom's love for peanut M&M's and my dad's for licorice, and all of that was my inspiration for Dylan's Candy Bar.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>The best souvenirs are sweet.</strong> When I was in Italy in college, Chupa Chups lollipops were big over there, and I literally filled a suitcase with them to take home. I also look for innovative candy packaging in my travels. I shop for candy instead of clothes!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>My husband is the cook at our house.</strong> I can make dessert and salad, but I stay away from meals. He makes amazing omelets, fish, and grilled vegetables like Brussels sprouts and cauliflower.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Halloween stresses me out. </strong>I always feel like people expect more from me. But you can't do better than candy corn or mellocremes--they're really candy corn, but they're pumpkin-shaped.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Outside of candy, I'm a health nut.</strong> It's important for me to eat really healthy because I have such a sweet tooth. I eat fish and vegetables for lunch and dinner, and I work out every day.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>4 THINGS YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND IN MY KITCHEN:</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>1. FIJI WATER BOTTLES.</strong>&#160;\"I try to stay hydrated!\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>2. EMERGEN-C.</strong>&#160;\"I keep packets of it on my counter to get my vitamins.\"</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. BANANAS.</strong>&#160;\"It's my best pre-workout fuel.\"</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. PLANTERS FLAVORED ALMONDS.</strong>&#160;\"Whenever I feel like I have low blood sugar, these are a great protein stabilizer.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>4 THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME:</h3>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>1. \"Sweet tooth\"</strong> doesn't even begin to cover it.\"I have a vanilla chai latte every morning, which I usually follow with an oatmeal raisin cookie and eggs for breakfast.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>2. \"We served Twinkies</strong> and Sno Balls at our wedding.

Eventually, I realized that these TV patriarchs were far too perfect, and now, as an adult (and husband and dad), I'd much rather watch people catch crustaceans off the coast of Russia on <em>Deadliest Catch</em>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But the drumbeat of excitement about the return of fall TV convinced me to give family sitcoms another shot. Shows about marriage and fatherhood are everywhere, and apparently, guys like me are watching them. Was I missing something? I decided to find out if the latest generation of TV dads is any more realistic than their idealized '80s predecessors.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: The answer is no. Sitcoms have simply swung to the other end of the spectrum, portraying dads as clueless, bumbling doofuses. Forget the perfection of Dr. Huxtable; these guys can barely muster the basic competency of Barney Rubble. At a moment when American dads are more involved in family life than ever, I, for one, am not amused. These are just a few things I want to yell at the TV:</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Being a hands-on dad is not emasculating.</strong></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>I warmed up by Hulu-ing a few existing hit shows that I'd never seen before. In an episode of <em>Up All Night</em> from last spring, stay-at-home dad Chris (Will Arnett) and his buddy Reed (Will Forte) attempt to recapture their manhood by building a motorcycle, then get frustrated and go on a shopping spree instead. Failing to man up is a recurring theme on many of the dad-centric sitcoms I checked out. Granted, dads change more diapers and prepare more bottles nowadays, but that doesn't make us wusses. Masculinity has evolved, not declined. Meanwhile, TV has backtracked: Tony Danza wore an apron and still managed to be plenty manly on <em>Who's the Boss?</em> There are always going to be instances when I feel \"man-downed\": when a scary-looking truck driver cuts in front of me in the rest-stop bathroom line; when I can't fix a sink; when I lose a fight with my wife, Karel. But being a good and present dad is not one of those times. I've never felt like less of man because I spend my days keeping my kids active, fed, safe, and learning, even if that means singing \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\" during story time at the library. Absurd, maybe, but never less of a man.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Kids are not props.</strong></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>I watched a lot of shows for this column, from <em>Modern Family </em>and <em>Parenthood</em> to advance screeners of new series like <em>Guys With Kids</em> and <em>The New Normal</em> on NBC and Fox's <em>Ben and Kate.</em> I quickly developed a drinking game to pass the time. The first rule was that every time a dad appeared carrying a baby in a baby carrier, an apparently ridiculous sight, you had to do a shot. <em>Guys With Kids</em> opens on three dudes with their backs to the cameras watching a basketball game at a bar. They turn around to trade high fives, and it is revealed that all three of them have babies strapped to their chests. I can't emphasize enough that involved, responsible dads don't bring their kids to bars; only dads who are degenerate gamblers and alcoholics do that. Think I'm being humorless? I also watched shows where dads used their babies to pick up women, help stalk ex-girlfriends, and act as good-luck charms at hockey games. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar inexplicably shows up at the end of the <em>Guys With Kids</em> pilot to \"dunk\" one of the babies for a picture so the dad can post it on Facebook. I didn't even know how to incorporate that scene into my drinking game.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Fathers are not 200-pound babies.</strong></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In case you haven't realized this yet, I was hard-pressed to find father figures who acted like grown-ups in these sitcoms. Phil Dunphy on <em>Modern Family</em> takes the cake. Don't get me wrong: Phil's hapless attempts to be cool are funny, but when every dad on the small screen begins to look like a variation of Phil, it's depressing. I've pulled my fair share of Phil moves--I once took my then-toddler son to an abandoned factory to photograph graffiti, only to realize (too late) that our excursion might be considered \"breaking and entering\" by an outside observer--but Karel has no patience for them, and that's a good thing. If I acted like these guys every day, no sane woman would've married, let alone procreated, with me.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In my opinion, all dads on TV should be more like Louis C.K. on <em>Louie.</em> This show is dark and uncomfortable, and Louie never falls into the sitcom traps mentioned above. He understands that in a world where everything is a joke, and often a cruel one, taking care of his kids is the only serious thing a guy can do. Louie may work his daughters into the comedy routines that open each episode, but when we see him brushing his younger daughter's teeth, or cooking them chicken cutlets for dinner, or taking them on a road trip to see an elderly aunt, it's clear that he never mistakes them or his fatherly responsibilities for the joke. Ninety-nine percent of the dads on TV today drive me to drinking games. Thank god this one doesn't, because I have to be up early, ready to go, for my kids.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Granted, dads change more diapers these days, but that doesn't make us wusses.</p>\n<h3>&#160;</h3>\n<p><em>REDBOOK columnist Aaron Traister lives in Philadelphia with his wife and two kids.

So when I found out I had inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), I planned to keep it to myself. But as I started researching my illness, I realized how little information is out there. IBC creates swelling and redness but doesn't necessarily form lumps or show up on a mammogram <em>or</em> an ultrasound, so it's often caught very late. I'm a well-informed woman, and I'd never even heard of it! That made me angry. I decided to talk to everyone I knew about IBC. I told a roomful of sorority sisters; I told the almost-all-male board of a nonprofit I'm involved in, and asked them to go home and tell their wives; I even stood up in front of my church congregation one Sunday and asked them to spread the word. I felt that if talking could possibly save one other woman, it would be worth it.

But somehow, through it all, my husband and boys (5 and 3 at the time) and I never stopped laughing. My youngest was fond of pointing at random bald men in the grocery store and happily exclaiming, 'Hey! My mommy doesn't have hair either!' Another time we were in hysterics when I had to grab both sides of my wig to keep it from launching off my head while on a free-fall amusement-park ride. My cancer's gone and my hair's back, so the wig's been given away. But our ability to laugh together, even when things are scary and hard, is something we'll always hold onto.\" --LORIE LAVINSON, 41, diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer three years ago</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Listen to your gut</em></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>\"I felt a lump in 2010, went for a mammogram, and got a card in the mail saying everything was fine. But I had a nagging feeling that the report was wrong, that the lump I found was <em>not</em> okay. I could feel it every time I showered or put on a bra. It was tiny and hard like a pebble, and I knew it shouldn't be there. So I went in for another mammogram at a different center. The radiologist explained that my breasts were very dense, which makes mammos difficult to read, so she wanted to do an ultrasound and biopsy the lump. The crazy thing is, those results came back fine too. But both my radiologist and my doctor didn't like the look of the lump and wanted to take it out. Further tests showed the tumor was Stage I breast cancer. Their intuition and mine saved me. I'm living proof that if you trust your instincts--in health matters, at work, in relationships--it can truly change your life.\" --JAMIE MACH, 44, diagnosed with Stage I breast cancer six months ago</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Don't be a \"someday\" person</em></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>\"Before my diagnosis, my husband and I hadn't taken a vacation in more than three years. Part of it was not wanting to spend the money, but it was also that we were set in our routine. As soon as my chemo and radiation treatments were over, we did it: We took our dream trip with our son to Disney World and had the time of our lives. Before cancer, we were always saying we wanted to do things 'someday,' but never following through. Now I know that it makes no sense to wait.

Frank Gehry codesigned the newest <a href=\"http://www.lapalestra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">La Palestra</a> fitness center, at the Plaza Hotel. What are some of its highlights?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Frank worked with us to preserve many of the Plaza&#146;s historic architectural details, while adding LEDs, an angular staircase, and flooring that ranges from rubber to wood.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> What advice do you have for setting up a home gym?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Do not put a bike in the bedroom. Separate the gym from the rest of the house. Consider safety: Make sure that machines don't stress the electrical system, and be careful when hanging heavy equipment from the walls.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> What are the main components of a well-rounded fitness room?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> I would include cardio, flexibility, and strength equipment, music or video for entertainment, and an exercise ball. A mirror lets you see what you are doing; it will also spread light throughout the area and make it feel larger. You'll want at least one full-length mirror.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> What if you have limited space to devote to exercise?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> Opt for a bike instead of a treadmill. Mount wall-hanging gear like a stretching ladder or chin-up bar. Use elastic bands.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> How do I select a cardio machine?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> It depends on use. If you exercise five times a week, you will need an industrial-strength machine like a Woodway or Cybex. If you work out only once or twice a week, you can get away with lower-end equipment.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> What are your favorite strength strategies for a home workout?</p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> I recommend kettlebells. They're small &#151; eight of them in different weights take up no more than three linear feet of space &#151; and can be used for almost every type of movement. If you have a larger area, consider a multi-station workout system with different machines, then add such basics as a bench, dumbbells, and a bar.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q:</b> Why focus on design in a utilitarian home gym? </p>\n\n<p><b>A:</b> If the space isn&#146;t appealing, you won't use it.</p>","article_links":[{"video_link":"","__total_count__":1,"slideshow_link":""}]}],"article_type_name":"Crosssite - Article 2.0 (Video Article)","publish_date":"2012-09-19T14:18:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"21558","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Abramovitch","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"apreiser","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_two_video","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11711418","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/home-remodeling/punch-list/home-gyms-ideas\">HOME GYMS: FORM MEETS FUNCTION</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebrity-style/hollywood-dream-homes-a-60814\">Hollywood Dream Homes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home-remodeling/vacation-home-ideas\">What the Pros Know: Vacation Homes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home-remodeling/design-ideas-for-small-spaces-a-19416\">Design Ideas For Small Spaces</a><br>\n<a href=\"/home-remodeling/gravity-defying-homes-a-48052\">Gravity-Defying Homes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/show-homes-32590\">Show Homes</a><br>\n<a href=\"/design-decorate/favorite-rooms-2012\">Your Favorite ELLE DECOR Rooms of 2012</a><br>\n<a href=\"/design-decorate/ideas/luxury-by-design\">Luxury by Design </a><br>\n<a href=\"/design-decorate/12-of-the-narrowest-homes-in-the-world-51974\">12 of the Narrowest Homes in the World</a><br>\n<a href=\"/design-decorate/the-best-met-homes-50498\">The Best Met Homes</a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1295","last_updated_date":"2013-02-07T06:12:43.000Z","author_id":"71829","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"elledecor","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-15T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"ELLE DECOR","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.elledecor.com/home-remodeling/punch-list/home-gyms-ideas","issue_date":"October 2012","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"It's here &#151; the designer collection for the rest of us!

Our offices are pretty amazing &#150; we have a gym, a library and lots of swanky chill-out areas. Employees here are given a lot of responsibility, which is brilliant. And I like the relaxed dress code!&#148; <br />&#160;<br /><strong>The bad:</strong> &#147;Working with the US means meetings can be scheduled late in the evening. Because deadlines are short and it&#146;s an informal working environment, things change all the time, which can be stressful.&#148; &#160;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/campus/student-careers/fab-fearless-entrepreneurs-female-graduates-campus?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">IS THERE HOPE FOR FEMALE GRADUATES?

I&#146;m lucky that my hours are fairly flexible and I can work from home when I need to. Because my husband&#146;s always up early, I usually head to a 6.30am circuit-training class in our local park &#150; it always wakes me up! If I&#146;m in the office, I&#146;ll leave the house around 8.15am and arrive at Google&#146;s central London office for 9am. <br /><br />&#147;I&#146;ve been at Google for six years &#150; my first job here involved spending six months in Google&#146;s Bangalore office in India working on their marketing strategy for YouTube (owned by Google). I heard about it through a friend and, after various roles here, I was eventually promoted to my current job. <br /><br />&#147;Working for one of the top three brands in the world can be hectic and I&#146;m always kept on my toes. My job means I work with our European and American offices a lot, so I get plenty of emails overnight that need dealing with first. There are several hundred people in the European marketing team and, once a week, we all dial in using Google+ (video conference) to catch up. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/cash-careers/who-runs-the-entrepreneurial-world-girls-women-lead-home-business\" target=\"_blank\">WHO RUNS THE WORLD? CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT</a><br /><br />&#147;Next, I usually have a mix of smaller meetings and projects to work on. Contact with other teams is usually email based. I&#146;ve always got lots of projects on the go &#150; one part of my job is working on the strategy and marketing for Google&#146;s Cultural Institute. It&#146;s an initiative to help promote culture online &#150; recently we digitalised Nelson Mandela&#146;s archives for the internet. I also work on campaigns like the Good To Know campaign, which helps parents to keep children safe on the web and teaches people how to protect their data. <br /><br />&#147;Lunch is usually at 1pm at work because we have an amazing canteen where all the food is free. We&#146;re allowed to invite friends or hold meetings there, so I&#146;ll often have a lunch meeting because everybody likes visiting us! <br /><br />&#147;My job means I also work on Google&#146;s famous &#145;Doodles&#146;, where we customise the homepage to mark special events like the Olympics. Anyone in the company can submit an idea and I review them, picking the most interesting. I then work with &#145;Doodlers&#146; in the States to make them. I&#146;m lucky enough to visit our head office in Mountain View, California, regularly too. It&#146;s amazing &#150; a huge campus that&#146;s so big you need bicycles to cycle between meetings. <br /><br />&#147;Usually I organise drinks with friends in the evening to make sure I leave on time &#150; around 6.30pm. If not, I like to cycle or run home &#150; I hate getting the tube that much!&#148; &#160;<br /><br /><strong></strong><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/the-cosmo-intern-blog/job-interview-tips?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">WANT TO KNOW HOW TO ACE AN INTERVIEW?

The 31-year-old fashion and accessories designer, who's also gearing up for season two of <em>Fashion Star</em>, adds <em>perfumer</em> to her r&#233;sum&#233; with her first fragrance, Nicole. \"I really thought outside the box for the name,\" she jokes of the soft blend of blackberry, amber, and patchouli. Here, she talks scents and get-ready shortcuts.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why did you want to create a fragrance?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>I've wanted to make a perfume since I was 12. I was inspired by my mom, a very traditional Southern woman who lived by the rule that you must look <em>and</em> smell your best when you leave the house.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Tell us your a.m. routine.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm not very good at doing my makeup, but styling my hair--<em>that</em> I have down pat. I start fresh every morning: I wet my hair, even if I don't end up shampooing it, apply K&#233;rastase Ol&#233;o serum, then blow it dry.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: And what if you have no time?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>My hair is naturally curly, so I've tried every type of wave-enhancing spray. The best one is Charlotte Ronson's--it gets my hair just the right amount of messy. I mist it on while my hair is still damp, then let it air-dry.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What's your red-carpet look?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>Red lips. I use a Nars pencil instead of lipstick: It lasts longer, and I can just scribble it on without having to be precise. Plus, it creates a nice matte finish.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you get all done up for a date with your hubby, rocker Joel Madden?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\n<p>He's locked in, so I don't wear makeup [for him]. He made that commitment when he married me!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Nicole's faves: </strong></p>\n<p><a

All electronic and mechanical devices eventually fail, and computer hard drives (even solid-state drives) are no exception. If you knew exactly when or how this was going to happen, you could plan a precise solution. But because you don't, redundancy is key. So if the one hard drive in your computer is prone to mechanical failure, it makes sense to have another drive on your desktop with duplicate data. That drive is just as likely to fail, though. What if you lost your family photos, tax records, documents, home videos, music, and saved games not because of a misaligned read/write head but because of a flood or a robbery or a house fire that wiped out both drives at the same time? Preparing for such a disaster calls for a different level of redundancy and a solution that includes backup in the cloud.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nCloud-based backup services fall into two camps: You can store select files in the cloud for remote access, or you can use a service that automatically backs up all your data. The former (Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft SkyDrive boast the best features) lets you park your files in \"smart\" folders that show up locally on your computer's hard drive but are also mirrored in the cloud. Once there, these files can be easily shared with friends&#151;a great way to pass around large files without overwhelming anybody's email inbox.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThese services all use the same basic business model: Each offers a limited amount of free storage (ranging from 2 GB for Dropbox to 7 GB for SkyDrive), then charges for a premium plan if you need more capacity. If you're going to upgrade, SkyDrive is the most affordable ($50 a year for 100 GB), while Dropbox ($200 a year for 100 GB) is the most expensive. But Dropbox is also the best for sharing your stuff&#151;its Public Folder feature gives you shareable URLs, so even non-Dropbox users can access select files. Google Drive ($60 a year for 100 GB) is the relative newcomer. The Web interface, which looks like Google Documents, lets you open 30 different file types directly in your browser. Both Google and Dropbox are friendly to developers, allowing them to integrate the companies' services into third-party apps, such as Pixlr, which lets users edit photos stored on Google Drive, and Simplenote, an app that syncs notes to Dropbox.   \n\n<br /><br />\n\nApple takes a less expansive approach to cloud storage with iCloud, which is free for up to 5 GB of data. ICloud backs up some of your files&#151;iWork documents created in iOS, for example, as well as photos&#151;while syncing them across your Mac and iOS devices. The service is great at moving your iPhone photos to your home computer or iPad (and for syncing downloaded apps to multiple iOS devices), but it isn't really designed to rescue you in a worst-case scenario.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Full-System Backup</strong></h3><br />\n\nStoring a few files in the cloud is simple and fast, but none of the Dropbox-like services comes even close to giving you full automated backups. For a task that titanic, the biggest names are Carbonite ($59 a year gets you unlimited storage) and Mozy ($72 for a year of 50 GB of storage). But the best pick for most users is Code 42's CrashPlan+. Techies in the know favor CrashPlan+ for its price (you get unlimited storage for $50 a year), ease of use, and wide range of features. But what really gives CrashPlan+ the edge is that, unlike its competitors, it holds on to your deleted files forever; most other services permanently delete files from the cloud after they've been off the computer for 30 days. (For permanent deletions, manually turn off syncing for the specific files you want to get rid of and CrashPlan+ will remove them from the backup.) One downside to these services: You risk losing files in your backup if you keep them only on external drives. Since these files don't live on your computer, as soon as you unplug your external hard drive, the files are considered deleted and are removed from the cloud for good 30 days later. Automatic erasing can also be a snag if you accidentally delete a file from your computer and don't notice until a month later.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nDespite some differences in interface, storage, and features, Mozy, Carbonite, and CrashPlan+ work in essentially the same way. On both Macs and PCs, you download a program that either runs on its own or as a part of the system software. You then choose which files and folders you want to back up. The program automatically uploads the latest versions of your files so your backup mirrors the data on your computer. There are, however, two major weaknesses to these services: None lets you back up system files, so you can't create complete full-system backups. Second, and more explicitly annoying, is how long the initial uploads take. Shipping hundreds of gigabytes to remote servers over a home Internet connection is an exercise in extreme patience. Depending on your connection speed and how much data you have, this digital drip can take weeks. Fortunately, after the first upload subsequent backups are quick and go by virtually unnoticed in the background. And with all three, except Carbonite on Macs, you can set backups to occur on a schedule. The cloud isn't just the safe way to back up your data, it's also the lazy way.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nPulling your data from Mozy, Carbonite, and CrashPlan+ is simple: You access your data through intuitive desktop applications (though Mozy's is by far the best-looking), where you can browse through backed-up folders and files. And if your computer does end up going kaput, you can easily resurrect your data by loading the software on another computer.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nDoes that mean your data, stored on a server in who-knows-where, is just as easy for others to resurrect too? So far, no. Though there are no guarantees against a snoop getting your password and looking at your photos, all the major backup services employ advanced encryption, and there have been no publicized cases of personal data compromised by prying eyes. Still, before you choose a backup service, make sure it does indeed use data encryption. Then you can jump into cloud backup relatively worry-free.\n\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<br />\n<table width=\"630\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16pt;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/how-to/tips/whose-cloud-music-service-is-the-best\">Whose Cloud Music Service is the Best? >>></h3><br />\n<img src=\"/cm/popularmechanics/images/zN/sound-cloud-03-0912-smn.jpg\" /></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-18T10:30:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"11024","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Porges","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"amoseman","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11992705","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/how-to-restore-your-data-after-a-hard-drive-crash\">How to Restore Your Data After a Hard Drive Crash</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/how-to-prevent-a-data-loss-disaster-11992705\">Back Up to the Cloud and Prevent a Data Loss Disaster</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/gadgets/reviews/4225613\">NAS200 Does Data Cloud Right with Painless Network Storage </a><br>\n<a href=\"/science/how-airplanes-punch-holes-in-clouds\">How Airplanes Punch Holes in Clouds (and Increase Snowfall Around Airports)</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/how-to-make-your-data-last-forever-14784944\">How to Make Your Data Last Forever</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/4235725\">Know Your Huge Hard Drives: What's the Right Backup Plan?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/technology/how-to/tips/4294038\">Don't Panic!

He didn't take money matters lightly, and while his words were meant to be freeing, they came with a tricky subtext: If money simply \"followed,\" then I really didn't need to worry about it. That message became part of my \"money script\"--a term financial therapists use for phrases that reveal our core beliefs about earning, saving, and spending. \"Your money personality can be directly related to the things your parents said,\" says New York--based psychotherapist Kachina Myers, who specializes in helping clients with money issues. Myers says that many children who get talks similar to the one my dad gave me adopt a financially careless attitude (\"If money isn't important, why know anything about it?\"). I grew up to earn a nice income as a writer and editor, but I saved very little and didn't bother to think about investing or retirement until my late 30s. Then the recession hit. I can't help but wish I'd put even a third of the money I blew on happy hours and beach vacations into a savings account. Then I'd be guaranteed mojitos during retirement, right? \"It's never too late to change how you think about money,\" says Myers. In my case, she suggests I start by reading all my bank statements. \"Money isn't the most important thing in life, but your cash needs to be working <em>for</em> you, and that won't happen if you ignore it,\" she says. While shaking off deep-rooted ideas about money won't be easy, pinpointing the language that has you operating at less than your full financial potential is exactly where you should start. Get a new take on the most familiar money lines below.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>THEY SAID: \"We can't afford it.\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>YOU HEARD: \"We have no control over what we can buy.\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>YOU MAY BE... in major debt.</strong></p>\n<p>Among all the unintentionally harmful money messages, \"this phrase is the biggest offender,\" says Liz Weston, author of <em>There Are No Dumb Questions About Money</em>. \"It implies there's some greater power dictating what the family can and can't buy, rather than presenting money decisions as choices.\" If your parents said this often, you're less likely to use budgets as an adult, so you're either the type to charge big-ticket items without a plan for how to pay for them (\"What the hell, I can't afford anything anyway\"), or you go to the other extreme--paralysis--like refusing to use your dishwasher (\"Think of what that'll do to our water bill!\"). To take back control, Weston suggests you change your inner dialogue. \"Instead of thinking, <em>I can't afford it</em>, you can say, 'I'm choosing not to buy that right now so I can purchase something else that's more important to me.' Once you frame purchases as options, you'll feel empowered.\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>THEY SAID: \"Ask your father.\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>YOU HEARD: \"Men are better with money.\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>YOU MAY BE... dangerously checked out of your financial life.</strong></p>\n<p>\"This is especially toxic for a daughter to hear,\" says Myers. \"Not only does it imply that men are in charge, but it says women can't set financial limits. A woman who absorbs this message might grow up thinking she's not entitled to take a stand, so she's less likely to negotiate with her spouse, her credit card company, or her boss when she deserves a raise.\" If you're the type to punt all the money decisions over to your guy, set regular once-a-month dates to review your family's finances, and make sure you know where your accounts are and how to access them. Then, talk to women you admire about how they handle their money.

Standing on the threshold of a tumbledown hut, inside the solid round wall of Grimspound&#146;s ancient settlement, you&#146;ll see the granite tors of Hameldown and Hookney rising tall on their ridges soften, melt and disappear. Out here in the timeless, elemental stillness of Dartmoor it&#146;s 2012 AD, but it could just as well be 2012 BC. A herd of stocky Dartmoor ponies ambles across the valley, their mist-moistened coats steaming in the warm morning air. The changing moods and atmospheres of Dartmoor are famous. Nowhere else in the south-west of England can show such a contrast between dark and light, sombre loneliness and sunlit beauty. Small communities cluster around the moor&#146;s edge, and ancient settlements lay scattered and remote across its boggy, silent interior. Dartmoor was designated a National Park in 1951, one of the first areas to be preserved in this way, and with good reason &#150; you&#146;ll find that it is a wilderness at heart, one of very few in these islands; part desert, part oasis, and wholly captivating.</p>\n<h3>Nature and heritage</h3>\n<p>Dartmoor is a skyline-to-skyline expanse of moorland, overlooked by jagged granite tors tufted with rustling silver grass and blanketed with heather. Patches of acid-green and ruby-red sphagnum moss betray the location of the famous Dartmoor bogs. Nature lovers will find pink rockets of marsh lousewort and bog pimpernel here, plus ancient, twisted dwarf oaks bearded with trailing lichens in Wistman&#146;s Wood near Two Bridges. Down in the lower land, under the high moor, you&#146;ll discover steep, green farming countryside dotted with villages, some still retaining their school, pub and post office, alongside stream valleys clothed in oak woods. Look out for kingfishers and the stout, white-chested figure of a dipper bobbing up and down on a mid-river stone. Man has left notable landmarks scattered across Dartmoor, including clapper bridges &#150; granite slabs resting on piers of the same rock (the one in Postbridge is probably the best known), as well as historic places of worship, such as Brentor Church on its rocky knoll in the west.</p>\n<h3>Moors and mystery</h3>\n<p>Most of Dartmoor is &#145;access land&#146;, where you are free to walk at will. Take the Ordnance Survey map, a compass or GPS, and proper walking gear, and follow the clear and easy routes of the Redlake Tramway from Ivybridge, or the Haytor Granite Tramway near Bovey Tracey. For those who prefer to explore on horseback, there are plenty ofstables catering for beginners, pony trekkers and galloping old hands alike &#150; try <a href=\"http://www.dartmoorstables.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shilstone Rocks Stables</a> in Widecombe-in-the-Moor. Prehistoric sites to visit include Grimspound ancient settlement and the Grey Wethers stone circles in the east, both wonderfully atmospheric.</p>\n<h3>Food, music and gardens</h3>\n<p>Indulge in some regional fare at one of Devon&#146;s culinary festivals. The <a href=\"http://www.ashburtonfoodfestival.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Ashburton Food & Drink Festival </a>(8 September 2012) has more than 50 stalls showcasing the produce available in and around the town, as well as street entertainment and cookery demonstrations from celebrity and local chefs. Newton Abbot&#146;s <a href=\"http://www.abbfest.org\" target=\"_blank\">Abbfest</a> (21-23 September 2012) has around 60 food, art and crafts stalls, while the <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth%20foodfestival.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth Food Festival</a> (26-28 October 2012) has become one of the biggest events of its kind, attracting high-profile chefs and foodies, such as Mark Hix and Valentine Warner. Music lovers shouldn&#146;t miss <a href=\"http://www.thetwomoorsfestival.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Two Moors Festival</a>, a week of classical music concerts in churches across Exmoor and Dartmoor (11-20 October 2012). Or try the <a href=\"http://www.baring-gould.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Baring Gould Folk Weekend </a>in Okehampton (26-28 October 2012).<br /><br />Anyone wishing to visit some historic houses will be spoilt for choice. For imposing splendour, try the neo-Gothic <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Castle Drogo</a> (01647 433306) near Drewsteignton, or <a href=\"http://www.buckfast.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Buckfast Abbey</a> (01364 645500), with its beautiful church, monastic buildings and shops full of local ceramics, candles and honey. Both have superb grounds, only bettered by <a href=\"http://www.thegardenhouse.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">The Garden House</a> at Buckland Monachorum (01822 854769), home to more than 6,000 plant varieties.</p>\n<h3>Living landscape</h3>\n<p>The sucking swamp of Fox Tor Mires is very quiet at six o&#146;clock on a late September morning; not a single birdcall breaks the profound silence. The old stones of the tumbledown Whiteworks tin mine are pearled with dew drops strung along invisible wires of spider webs. There are patches of purple heather sprinkled over the amber and chocolate face of the mire, which steams lightly like a pudding on a hob.<br /><br />A flight of tiny, twittering goldcrests alights in a silver birch, a slender white tree with a froth of trembling leaves already tinged with yellow. Three dark moor ponies are moving across the face of Crane Hill on the far side of Fox Tor Mires; they know better than to stray out among its treacherous sphagnum that is a brilliant green, as soft as butter and many feet deep. <br /><br />This is the setting for the climactic scene of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles', with the fiery beast bursting out of the mist and Sherlock Holmes appearing in the nick of time to save the day. On a magical morning, you can almost glimpse it for yourself.</p>\n<h3>Old-world charm</h3>\n<p>Granite is the rock hereabouts, and vernacular architecture is on the solid side. Chagford is a handsome market town in north-east Dartmoor, and possesses a gem in the traditional ironmongers and general stores of Webber & Sons (01647 432213) and James Bowden & Son (01647 433271), side by side in The Square. <br /><br />Nearby Bovey Tracey has the characterful Old Cottage Tea Shop in Fore Street (01626 833430), and the <a href=\"http://www.crafts.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Devon Guild of Craftsmen</a> in Riverside Mill (01626 832223), which runs exhibitions, have-a-go sessions and sales of local handiwork. <br /><br />For picture-postcard villages, head to Widecombe-in-the-Moor, with its tall-towered church and village green, or North Bovey for its thatched cottages. And don&#146;t leave without seeing the prison at Princetown &#150; it&#146;s not pretty, but it&#146;s one of Dartmoor&#146;s most arresting sights.</p>\n<h3>Where to eat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.22millst.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>22 Mill Street, Chagford</strong> </a><br />Tucked away in a back street of one of Dartmoor&#146;s ancient towns, this restaurant has wonderful views over the moor. The menu includes local meat, fish and cheese in dishes that change with the seasons (01647 432244).<br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.rock-inn.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Rock Inn</a>, Haytor, near Bovey Tracey</strong><br />This former 18th-century coaching inn serves up local seafood such as mussels from the River Teign as well as meat from the moor and Devon cheeses. Commandeer the cosy snug next to the bar on a chilly evening or enjoy an alfresco lunch in the garden on warm days (01364 661305).<br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.ullacombefarm.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Ullacombe Farm</a> shop, between Bovey Tracey and Haytor</strong> <br />You can find Dartmoor meat, eggs and vegetables, plus homemade preserves, pies and cakes here. Warm up with a bowl of homemade soup by the woodburning stove in the caf&#233; (01364 661341).</p>\n<h3>Where to stay</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.appletreebandb.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Tree Bed & Breakfast,</a> Tavistock</strong><br />A contemporary boutique B&B based in a Grade II-listed Victorian house with a feel of understated elegance in the three airy, en-suite guest rooms &#150; two doubles and a twin &#150; all of which have WiFi and flatscreen televisions. Doubles from &#163;65 a night (01822 617639).<br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.cadleigh.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Cadleigh Manor,</a> Ivybridge</strong><br />This quiet, traditional guesthouse is located on the southern edge of the National Park and offers three comfortable double rooms. The highlight however, is the full English breakfast with sausages and bacon from the owners&#146; free-range Gloucester Old Spot crosses, eggs laid by their hens, and freshly pressed apple juice. Those preferring a lighter option can enjoy homemade preserves and croissants. Doubles from &#163;60 per night (01752 895678). <br /><br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.littleshotts.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Little Shotts</a>, Haytor</strong><br />If you&#146;re looking for a more remote and quirky place to stay, this self-catering hut set in woodland is perfect. Situated on the edge of the Dartmoor National Park, Little Schotts is a rustic wooden cabin that sleeps four. For relaxed suppers, the Rock Inn, a traditional country pub serving excellent food and fine local ales, is just a short stroll away. From &#163;267 for a three-night break (01364 661536).</p>\n<h3>Our National Parks need you!</h3>\n<p>The Campaign for National Parks is Country Living&#146;s Charity of the Year. For the past 75 years, it has been dedicated to &#145;keeping beautiful places safe&#146;. In this area, it has been working with the Dartmoor Mires Project, which is conserving the moor&#146;s blanket bog &#150; a critical habitat for upland wildlife and an important carbon store.

This traditional Cotswold home belongs to Caroline and Richard de Wolf who, as former owners of Burford&#146;s Lamb Inn (see below), strike the perfect balance between the personal attention of a B&B and the service of a hotel. Boxtree has two spacious guest rooms, both with king-sized double beds featuring Sanderson fabrics, French-inspired furniture and contemporary en suite bathrooms. In the morning, you can enjoy a feast of fresh fruit, cereal, croissants and a choice of Continental or cooked breakfast, all made with the best local and organic ingredients wherever possible and, on warm days, served on the terrace in Boxtree&#146;s beautiful walled garden. <em>B&B from &#163;85 per night.</em></p>\n<h3>Eat&#133;</h3>\n<p>It&#146;s hard to go hungry in Burford.

I happened to be there just as this couple arrived, and the concierge stepped away and we were short-staffed, so I wound up carrying their luggage to their room. Even they laughed.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>What do you like about living in Bedford?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>It's stunningly beautiful, and quiet and soulful.

My life is pretty simple and normal. I'm in love with my wife [the actress Carey Lowell] and I love my son, and they're the center of my universe.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>That's so sweet. What are you guys into?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Carey is into pottery. We're baseball people. It's my seventh year that I've coached Little League. My son [Homer] just graduated from the program.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>I hear you have quite the collection of guitars, and you recently auctioned them off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Each one of them had a story to me, but with the urging of my wife, I sold 120 of them for a good cause--helping the Tibetan people, HIV-AIDS research, and disaster relief in India.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>So--wait. Your wife asked you to lose the guitars. Are you a hoarder?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>If you asked Carey, she'd say yes. Guitars take up a lot of space.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Do you still play guitar every day?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>What else do you do every day?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>I meditate. Daily practice is essential to my life.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>How long have you been a Buddhist?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Forty years.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Has it made you mellower?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes I'm kind of spacey. I'm like Ferdinand the bull, sniffing the daisy, not aware of time, of what's going on in the real world.

The answer may lie in our bedrooms.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the first thing you do in the morning: roll over and kiss the person lying next to you, or lean across for your mobile? &#8216;Oh, but I use my phone as my alarm clock,&#8217; I hear you say. That&#8217;s all very well, but grabbing your phone before doing anything else means the temptation&#8217;s right there in your hands: you may as well scan your emails, update your Facebook status and check the weather forecast while you&#8217;re at it. Before you know it, you&#8217;re late for work and only have time for a hasty goodbye to your husband as you dash out. So much for that quickie before breakfast&#8230;</p>\n<p>Experts tell us that our beds should be used for sex and sleep only, but too many of us insist on bringing third parties &#8211; laptops, phones or TVs &#8211; into the boudoir, and the distraction can put a right dampener on our sex life. Take the TV. If you reckon it&#8217;d be a good idea to make a habit of watching it in bed, think again. One Italian study found couples with a set in their bedroom have sex only half as often as those who don&#8217;t. And the effect is even more marked in the case of over-50s, with a 60% drop in sex. It&#8217;s hard enough for most of us to find time for sex at the best of times, but how will the opportunity ever arise if your man&#8217;s glued to the TV and you&#8217;re busy posting on Mumsnet yet again?</p>\n<p>One in four of us text before we nod off at night, and over a third of us admit we bring our laptops to bed. It hardly takes a genius to work out that more time staring at screens means less time making love. Maybe these gadgets come in handy if you&#8217;re trying to avoid sex, but it's hardly grown-up to hide your problems behind technology.</p>\n<p>So how can you regain that intimacy when you&#8217;re used to spending all your quality time in front of the telly? One answer is to have a &#8216;no gadgets after 10pm&#8217; rule. Turn everything off and spend that time talking to and touching your other half instead. And if you truly prefer being online to talking to your partner, get some help or find someone else. It can be horribly lonely in bed with just a laptop to cuddle&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Did you know </strong>A recent US survey found that 12% of American mothers use their mobile phones during sex!</p>\n<h3>You might also like...</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/sex-life/five-simple-relationship-boosters-52237\" target=\"_blank\">Five simple relationship boosters</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/sex-life/so-youve-stopped-having-sex-36795\" target=\"_blank\">So you've stopped having sex</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/sex-life/fancy-a-dirty-weekend-58647\" target=\"_blank\">Fancy a dirty weekend?</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-11T11:54:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11944295","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-05T14:28:25.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-22T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/sex-life/Is-technology-killing-your-love-life-sex-advice","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"See inside Vera Wang president Mario Grauso's NYC apartment he shares with Brood designer Serkan Sarier.","site_id":"17","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.harpersbazaar.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"jking","keywords":"","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"The House: Tribeca Grand","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-09-10T01:43:21.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Elisa","source_id":"1","teaser":"See inside Vera Wang president Mario Grauso's NYC apartment he shares with Brood designer Serkan Sarier.","origin_site_id":"17","sub_heading":"Vera Wang president Mario Grauso shows off the new Manhattan apartment he shares with Brood designer Serkan Sarier. <b>Photographs by Nikolas Koenig.

And with good reason: The detritus of unpacking, like a slow-moving tsunami, washes up on the shoals of countertops and in corners long after the moving trucks rumble off. But wander into the meticulously decorated TriBeCa loft of Vera Wang president Mario Grauso and his partner, Brood designer Serkan Sarier, just days after their arrival and it looks as if every Nymphenburg creature has been artfully nestled in its spot for years.</p>\n<p>It's all thanks to Grauso's secret fixer: Big Mike. \"He brings like 20 guys and makes it all happen,\" Grauso says as he surveys the sprawling, sumptuous loft. \"And Mike is <em>very</em> big,\" adds Sarier. Of course, Grauso and Sarier had done enough advance strategy to impress the joint chiefs of staff, including diagramming the floor plan of the three-bedroom apartment and numbering Polaroids of every George Smith sofa and Walton Ford print to a corresponding map. \"Well, what do you want us to do at night?\" jokes Grauso. \"We're either talking about fashion or we're planning the house. I mean, we're anal-retentive.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was like Tetris,\" says Sarier, miming blocks fitting together. \"Everything went into place.\" It's a game they've clearly mastered. The resulting decor is a perfect marriage of tastes, reflecting both the fast-talking Grauso, a native New Yorker known for his power plays in the fashion field, and the charming Sarier, a young designer whose soft-spoken English belies his Turkish-Bosnian-by-way-of-Germany upbringing. The two are a yin and yang of the pragmatic and the exotic.</p>\n<p>\"You can tell when pieces are Serkan's,\" says Grauso. \"He likes things that are a bit more extreme; I like things to be user-friendly. It's because of me there's a place to sit. Otherwise, you'd be sitting on a weird rock on the floor.\" Adds Sarier, \"We really balance each other.\" Case in point: a Horst P. Horst print of Coco Chanel from Grauso's extensive photo collection juxtaposed with Sarier's stark image of a leather-clad Leigh Bowery.</p>\n<p>While the pair have seamlessly combined their eclectic possessions&#8212;including a cabinetful of oceanic curiosities, enough art books to fill the Parsons library, and a suit of Japanese armor&#8212;they revel in picking up pieces to stock their new space. \"Mario doesn't hold back,\" says Marjorie Gubelmann, Grauso's shopping partner in crime, who has accompanied him everywhere from Sur la Table to Ted Muehling's boutique. \"He is loaded with bags. He's like Richard Gere in <em>Pretty Woman.</em>\" Much of what he buys will be gifts for friends or family. \"He is very generous,\" says Tory Burch, who in turn gifted them with an antique ivory hand from their mutual favorite shop, De Vera.</p>\n<p>It was Sarier, however, who found the apartment, using the Web site StreetEasy. It met all of the couple's requirements: Grauso's that it be more than 3,000 square feet (to accommodate the two busy professionals and their two dogs&#8212;a bulldog named Georgia and a pin-thin Italian greyhound named Lily&#8212;plus a bedroom suite for Grauso's teenage son, Harry, on his frequent visits home from boarding school), and Sarier's that it get lots of sun. \"Because as somber as Mario portrays me, I like literal light,\" he says with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>The fifth-floor aerie is also conveniently located near the Brood studios (a \"conspiracy,\" Grauso teases), which allows more time at home. \"We make sure we're a family,\" says Sarier. \"When Harry is here, we spend as much time with him as possible,\" adds Grauso. \"Every night we have dinner.\" Now a vegan, gluten-free devotee, he maintains his slimmed-down physique by ordering roasted vegetables and salads at Sant Ambreous or Milos. On nights at home, supper is served on Herm&#232;s plates at what he's dubbed the \"take-out table,\" a marble round surrounded by toile chairs under a grand crystal chandelier&#8212;all transported from the Paris pied-&#224;-terre that Grauso shared with his ex-wife.</p>\n<p>That table was instantly put to use: Days after moving in, Grauso and Sarier hosted a dinner party for 12, on the same night as the MTV Movie Awards, at which Emma Watson wore Brood. \"I had the computer on my lap waiting for a picture to come up online,\" Grauso recalls. \"Serkan gets so excited&#8212;it's fun to watch. It energizes me, because you lose that the longer you're in the business.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mario has tapped into many new territories since we've been together,\" explains Sarier. In fact, he has managed to entice Grauso far afield from his usual New York haunts. \"You should see me walking through the East Village,\" says Grauso, who has even invited boss Vera Wang to dine on East Seventh Street at a new favorite Greek eatery, Pylos. Similarly, Sarier's design for the leather-clad master bed headboard required many trips to a carpenter in Queens. \"Serkan made me drive him there six times, and I was like, 'Where are we?

So I'm surprised--and deeply relieved--to find the former <em>Biggest Loser</em> trainer in a slouchy hoodie, yoga pants, and an NYPD baseball cap--fashion code for <em>sleep-starved new mom</em>. \"I thought we'd just hang today,\" she says in a raspy voice as she leads me into her loft-like duplex. Surveying the scene--baby gates everywhere; mountains of tiny onesies, socks, and crib sheets waiting to be folded; a 2-month-old in a bouncy seat and a giggly toddler playing in an empty laundry basket--I realize the only kind of workout we'll get today is keeping up with Jillian's kids.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In May, the petite powerhouse and her partner, Heidi Rhoades, went from being a couple to a family of four in the space of a week, adopting 2-year-old daughter Lukensia from Haiti days after Heidi gave birth to their son, Phoenix. The sudden expansion left Jillian exhausted, and forced her to rethink everything that matters to her--including her body. Beneath the layers of clothes, Jillian's looking a little curvier, and she's fine with it. \"I got my boobs back,\" she says, laughing. The body change makes sense, given that she no longer has arsenals of time to tone and sculpt. \"Oh, my God!\" she says, exhaling loudly. \"I count how long it takes me to run up and down these stairs with her in my arms. That's my workout!\" And with that, Jillian folds over laughing, banging her fist on the table, as if she just heard the funniest joke. But make no mistake: Ms. <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Master-Your-Metabolism-Naturally-Balancing/dp/0307450740/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1347332934&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=Master+Your+Metabolism\" target=\"_blank\">Master Your Metabolism</a></em> hasn't given up on the fit life. She's rolling out a new DVD called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Jillian-Michaels-Body-Revolution-DVDs/dp/B0084ELJVI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1347332858&sr=8-3&keywords=Jillian+Michaels+Body+Revolution\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jillian Michaels Body Revolution</em></a>, which features 30-minute workout blasts designed to whittle you down in 90 days. She's also creating an intense new interval program for Crunch Gyms called <a href=\"http://www.crunch.com/en/Centerstage/Events/JILLIAN%20MICHAELS%20BODYSHRED.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bodyshred</a>. And she's writing a book on healthy pregnancy. In fact, she seems more resolved than ever to help us all stay in shape and eat right, in a way that actually works for real people.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>\"It's the new me,\" she says, rubbing Lu's runny nose with her hand. Is this how Jillian pictured life with kids? \"Wiping snot with my bare fingers? No!\" she says. \"But I'm more fulfilled than I've ever been. I think there was always a little bit of emptiness that I tried to fill with something. When I was a kid it was food, then it was success, and then it wasn't enough success--it was achievements. Heidi helped a lot and settled me down, but the kids have made me reevaluate everything.\" Her new life math includes five more pounds, immeasurable wisdom, and the occasional booger. Give it up for the Biggest Gainer, Jillian.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>REDBOOK: What have these past few months been like for you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JILLIAN MICHAELS:</strong> At first it was a serious wake-up call. We suddenly had a 2-year-old--who has a major personality. The kid is Houdini! She can get in and out of anything. I spend my days trying to out think her. She'll open the baby gates and look at us like we're complete idiots.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Have you found your footing yet?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> We have a rhythm, and I wouldn't say it's easy, but I don't wake up and go, \"Oh, my God! I'm totally overwhelmed!\"</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Tell me about those first few days.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> There were several first few days. There were a few with this little guy, and that to me was just awful. I thought I was going to cry [at the birth], but it was so shocking for me. Heidi's terrified, there's blood everywhere, and Phoenix is screaming... All I could think was, <em>What have we gotten ourselves into?</em></p>\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\n<p><strong>RB: So your first response to your son wasn't tears, but abject horror?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Yeah! I was like, \"Wow! Welcome to feeling completely helpless,\" which is <em>not</em> a feeling I enjoy. If there's something I hate the most, it's feeling helpless, powerless. And I felt all those things.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>RB: When was the last time you felt that way?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> When I was a preteen and my parents got divorced, and I was really troubled. I make a habit of not feeling that way.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: But you got two kids in a week!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM: </strong>The moment we got Phoenix home, I left to pick this one up. [<em>Lukensia pipes up: </em>\"I wuv you!\"] I love you too, weirdo! She loves to jump in the pool. The kid is fearless.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Do you hover over her and worry?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Kids are accident-prone; they're going to tumble. As long as I know she's not going to die or get badly hurt, it's okay. We'd rather her be adventurous, and fall and get back up, than helicopter around her and make her feel fragile.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>RB: Did your mom turn you into a daredevil?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> It was my dad. He used to put me on his motorcycle, which I will <em>not</em> do. He used to challenge me to jump off the high dive. My dad was a crazy person, but some of the best qualities about me came from him. My mom was always paranoid, and he was like, \"Eh, you'll be fine.\" I'm like that. I have this intrinsic sense that everything will be okay.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-11T04:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"promo_image_id":"1596878","votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":"/cm/redbook/images/o3/rbk-jillian-michaels-1-1012-smn.jpg","total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Fox","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"afeuer","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11761812","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/jillian-michaels-adoption-biggest-loser-interview\">The Brand-New Life of Jillian Michaels </a><br>\n<a href=\"/fun-contests/jillian-michaels-interview\">Jillian Michaels Wants to Transform Your Life</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fun-contests/jillian-michaels\">Jillian Michaels Gets Personal About Her Biggest Dream Yet</a><br>\n<a href=\"/online-sweepstakes/official-rules-jillian-michaels-sweepstakes\">OFFICIAL RULES - THE JILLIAN MICHAELS PRIZE PACK SWEEPSTAKES</a><br>\n<a href=\"/fun-contests/jillian-michaels-diet-program\">Jillian Michaels &rsquo;s 4 Rules for a Slim Body This Winter</a><br>\n<a href=\"/video/you-can-leave-it-does-get-better---jillian-michaels-fitness-expert-video-1834350827001\">\"You can leave.

How can I stop them making a noise?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bridget Bodoano says:</strong><br />Squeaks and creaks are caused by the floorboards rubbing against one another or a joist. A simple remedy is to sprinkle the join with talcum powder and brush it down between the offending boards. However, creaks are often a sign that the boards are loose, so check for loose or missing nails. Pull out loose nails using a claw hammer or pincers and replace with new floorboard nails. If the boards are old and the holes have become too big for a new nail, replace them with screws. A word of warning &#150; if it&#146;s not possible to re-fix in the existing holes you must lift the floorboard (find instructions online or in a DIY manual) to check that there are no wires or pipes beneath. You can then drill a new pilot hole alongside the old hole and secure the board with a new nail. Age, heat, damage and damp cause wood to warp and stretch so that it flexes and creaks when walked on &#150; replacing the floorboard often solves the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>You might also like...<br /></strong><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/home/advice/Painting-sash-windows-expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\">How to paint sash windows</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/home/advice/replace-extension-roof-expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\">Replacing the roof of an old extension</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/home/advice/Resolving-a-neighbourly-dispute-expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\"> Resolving a neighbourly dispute</a></p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-10T16:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-cmuskoron","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11642275","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-11T16:26:41.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-13T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/home/advice/squeaking-floorboards-expert-advice","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Polka-dots are a perennial fave, and we've got the tutorial to show you how to do a polka-dot nail look.

It usually begins in late July with dessert varieties, such as Early Laxton and Early Rivers (for eating) and Pershore and Czar (for cooking). <br /><br />Greengages are considered to be the sweetest and the finest of the dessert plums &#150; they also make exceptional jam. In August and September, the red-skinned, yellow-fleshed Victoria plum is the type most often found in gardens and is equally delicious when cooked or eaten straight from the tree.<br /><br />Damsons, bullaces and sloes, the tartest variety, are only suitable for cooking &#150; find them in hedgerows from September to November. Sloes, the fruit of the blackthorn, are thought to be the only plum species native to Britain. They are too astringent to eat raw, so prick them with a skewer and infuse in a large covered jar with plenty of gin and sugar for a few months. By Christmas, the sloe gin will be ready to raise a glass in celebration.<br /><br /><strong>What to look for</strong> <br />Choose firm fruit with good colour, a healthy bloom and a little give, which indicates ripeness; avoid any that are bruised or have soft mushy spots.<br /><br /><strong>Which variety?</strong> <br />Plums vary in colour from yellow and green through to red, purple and bluish black; they can be sweet and juicy to mouth-puckeringly sour, such as sloes and damsons. <br /><br /><strong>How to store</strong> <br />Place for three to four days in a cool place. Freeze whole or halved, then use for crumbles and pies. Firmer-fleshed plums, mostly the blue-black varieties, are ideal for bottling in sugar syrup or alcohol. <br /><br /><strong>To prepare</strong> <br />Some cooking plums have tough skins that can be hard to digest: remove by immersing in hot water for 30 seconds, then peeling like a tomato. However, cooking softens most skins. Use in pies, crumbles and tarts; alternatively, poach or roast for a simple dessert. When preparing plums for making jam, crack open the stones and add the kernels for a pleasing almond flavour. If making damson preserve, don&#146;t bother to remove the skins or stones; instead, skim from the surface just before potting.</p>\n<h3>Look here too..</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/search/fast_search_recipes?search_term=plums\" target=\"_blank\">More plum recipes</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/food/so-in-season-september-foods-45213\" target=\"_blank\">September foods and recipes </a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/food/10-quick-easy-desserts-44247\" target=\"_blank\">10 quick and easy desserts</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-10T10:55:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-cmuskoron","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11512676","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-11T09:47:43.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/food/wisdom/easy-plum-recipes-cooking-plums","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"A fabulously fruity dessert","site_id":"601","mobile1_template_id":null,"origin_site_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com","import_modified_by":null,"checked_out_by":"","keywords":"fruity ice cream, Country Living, easy ice cream recipe, damson, how to make ice cream, fruity ice cream recipe, fruity desserts, ice cream recipes, easy summer desserts, damson recipes, how to make ripple ice cream, making ice cream, damson recipe, unusual ice cream recipe, best ice cream recipes, ice cream recipe, ripple ice cream recipe, damson ice cream, cooking with damsons","rate":"0.00","promo_title":"Damson-ripple ice cream recipe","source_last_updated_date":null,"source_expire_date":null,"checked_out_date":"2012-09-10T11:04:59.000Z","related_links_list":[],"headline_image_url":null,"author_first_name":"Unknown","source_id":"636","teaser":"A fabulously fruity dessert","origin_site_id":"601","sub_heading":"The tartness of the damson ripple is a perfect foil to the rich vanilla ice cream.

CLICK HERE</a><br /><br />\"I run the production of The X Factor, so the whole show is my responsibility. I&#146;ve worked on it for 18 months and I do everything from looking after the judges to casting contestants and overseeing a team of 50 production staff. Work on the show runs from February through to December &#150; I usually take a holiday in-between &#150; and can be based anywhere. I tour the country twice a year, hold boot-camp sessions and film abroad in the judges&#146; houses before live finals in the studio. It&#146;s a marathon!<br /><br />&#147;I&#146;m married with two young children, so if we&#146;re filming in London, I&#146;ll eat breakfast at home and drop my eldest at school. I get picked up around 9.15am and arrive an hour before the judges to check everything&#146;s running smoothly. When they get there, I sort any problems. I act as their eyes and ears so, if I think a contestant is good or has an interesting story, I give them a heads-up. I&#146;ll make other suggestions too. Last year, I wanted Janet Devlin to sing Cyndi Lauper&#146;s True Colors and so did Kelly Rowland, but Janet wasn&#146;t keen, so it didn&#146;t happen.</p>\n<p>&#147;I also cast the judges, and was involved in recruiting Nicole Scherzinger this year. Last year, I suggested Tulisa. Before I joined X Factor, I cast I&#146;m A Celebrity&#133; Get Me Out Of Here and my husband told me about Tulisa after watching Being&#133; N-Dubz. She turned down I&#146;m A Celebrity but I was thrilled when she joined X Factor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/lifestyle/has-rita-ora-got-the-x-factor-2012?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">RECKON RITA ORA HAS THE X FACTOR? WE DO! FIND OUT WHY...</a><br /><br />&#147;During auditions, we take a lunch break at about 4pm while a new audience comes in. I&#146;ll often order something with the judges &#150; Tulisa loves Nando&#146;s! <br /><br />&#147;Sometimes our series producer comes to me with problems like, &#145;This person&#146;s dropped out&#146;, so I have to think on my feet. Everything on the show is scrutinised but I think I function best under pressure.&#160;<br /><br />&#147;My day normally finishes around 7pm, but sometimes I have conference calls to LA scheduled at night. I talk to Simon Cowell regularly. He&#146;s a brilliant person to work for and a perfectionist, which makes us all want to work harder.<br /><br /> &#147;If I&#146;m in London, I&#146;ll spend the evening with my family, but if we&#146;re on the road I&#146;ll head to a bar with the judges.&#148;</p>\n<p><strong>STILL INTERESTED?</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Qualifications:</strong> &#147;I&#146;ve got a media degree but you don&#146;t need one &#150; work experience is vital though. Most people start as a runner and hope to work their way up to researcher, assistant producer and, potentially, producer or director.&#148; <br /><strong>Salary:</strong> TV company Thames doesn&#146;t reveal salaries, but a similar role on a high- profile show can earn &#163;100,000 plus. <br /><strong>Key skills:</strong> &#147;Tenacity and keeping cool under pressure.&#148;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/fashion/news/cosmo-goes-backstage-with-the-x-factor-style-team\" target=\"_blank\">LET COSMO TAKE YOU BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE X FACTOR...</a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-08T17:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"18771","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"2","author_last_name":"","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-zbriggs","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11508601","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/fashion/cosmo-goes-backstage-with-the-x-factor-style-team\">Cosmo goes backstage with the X Factor Style Team</a><br>\n<a href=\"/campus/cosmo-on-campus-the-big-fashion-issue-autumn-2012-for-university-students-is-out-now-and-full-of-competitions\">The Big Fashion Issue of Cosmo On Campus is out now</a><br>\n<a href=\"/campus/celebrities-failure-to-success\">Celebrities who beat failure</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebs/10-reasons-why-cosmo-want-times-red-in-the-live-x-factor-shows\">10 reasons why Cosmo want Times Red in the live X Factor shows</a><br>\n<a href=\"/lifestyle/quiz-have-you-got-the-x-factor\">Have you got the X Factor ?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/lifestyle/the-weekend-big-issue-the-x-factor-86439\">The weekend big issue: The X Factor </a><br>\n<a href=\"/beauty-hair/the-backstage-secrets-of-x-factor-halloween-week__\">Backstage secrets of X Factor's Halloween Week</a><br>\n<a href=\"/celebs/james-arthur-wins-x-factor-2012-matt-cardle-twitter-rant-9486\">Congratulations James Arthur!

Originally from Northampton, England, the face painter developed an early eye for color and contouring by watching classic Hollywood films and immersing herself in the '80s London music scene. McGrath's ability to balance natural beauty with a flair for the dramatic propelled her to fame, as she racked up credits at shows for John Galliano and Dior and in advertising campaigns for Jil Sander and Yves Saint Laurent. Now, as the global creative design director of P&G Beauty, she shapes the looks at numerous Fashion Week shows, experimenting with everything from bleached brows to outr&#233; eyes to smoldering red lips.

Try Buscopan (&#163;4.48 from pharmacies), which helps to relieve abdominal pain.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>You eat too much wheat</h3>\n<p><strong><strong>Symptom:</strong></strong> Muffin top &#8211; says it all. <br /><strong><strong>Is this you?</strong></strong> You love bread and pasta &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t love you. According to US cardiologist William Davis: &#8216;Genetic engineering to make wheat pest-resistant has turned it into a super-carb that wreaks havoc on your body, causing conditions I&#8217;ve termed wheat belly, pizza brain, bagel bowel and biscuit face.&#8217; <br /><strong><strong>What to do: </strong></strong>&#8216;Give up wheat and you will stop craving it and start losing weight,&#8217; says Dr Davis. &#8216;In studies, obese coeliac patients lost an average 27.5lb in their first six months on a wheat-free diet.&#8217; Find out more in his book, <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781609611545\" target=\"_blank\">'Wheat Belly'</a> (Rodale, &#163;17.99).</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re not regular&#160;&#160; &#160;</h3>\n<p><strong><strong>Symptom:</strong></strong> You&#8217;re stuck for ways of treating your constipation. <br /><strong><strong>Is this you?</strong> </strong>You eat healthily but still don&#8217;t go to the loo regularly enough. You&#8217;re reluctant to try laxatives in case you become dependent on them. <br /><strong><strong>What to do:</strong> </strong>Take them &#8211; they&#8217;re safer than you think, says Professor Whorwell. &#8216;Modern laxatives don&#8217;t make the gut lazy. Ask your pharmacist<br />for macrogol, bisacodyl or senna.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>You bottle up emotions</h3>\n<p><strong><strong>Symptom:</strong></strong> You&#8217;re mystified by your IBS diagnosis. <br /><strong><strong>Is this you?</strong> </strong>You suffer with IBS but haven&#8217;t found a food link to your problems. If you keep a lid on your feelings, your gut could be trying to tell you something &#8211; it&#8217;s so closely linked to the brain that it feels stress even when you are not acknowledging it, says Dr Nick Read of The IBS Network. <br /><strong><strong>What to do:</strong> </strong>Take note of emotional triggers, as well as issues around food, advises Dr Read. &#8216;Does your IBS flare up around work, travel or certain people? Does it calm down at weekends, in the evenings or on holiday?&#8217; Try hypnotherapy &#8211; find a therapist at <a href=\"http://www.bsch.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">www.bsch.org.uk</a> or use relaxation MP3s and CDs (from &#163;9.50) from <a href=\"http://www.ursulajames.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ursulajames.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>You take on too much</h3>\n<p><strong><strong>Symptom:</strong></strong> The fat on the front of your tummy feels hard rather than wobbly. <br /><strong><strong>Is this you?</strong></strong>&#160;Even if your tummy&#8217;s okay on the inside, the stress hormone cortisol causes fat to gather on the belly, says Dr Marilyn Glenville, author of <a href=\"http://www.allaboutyoubookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781856266550\" target=\"_blank\">'Fat Around the Middle'</a> (Kyle Cathie, &#163;9.99). <br /><strong><strong>What to do:</strong></strong> Take control of the stress triggers in your life. You may not be able to change your job or boss, but you can cut down on caffeine, which heightens stress. Yoga and walking both help, too.</p>\n<h3>You crave junk food</h3>\n<p><strong><strong>Symptoms:</strong></strong> Overweight and bloated, heartburn, bad breath and indigestion. <br /><strong><strong>Is this you?</strong></strong>&#160;You&#8217;re tired, overweight, prone to mood swings and infections &#8211; all signs of toxicity, says Shona Wilkinson, senior nutritionist at Nutricentre.com. <br /><strong><strong>What to do:</strong></strong> Swap processed foods for a natural diet, cut down on cigarettes and alcohol. Toxins also come from cosmetics, plastics, pesticides and pollution, says Shona. &#8216;The natural mineral supplement Zeolite Thrace (&#163;22.99 for 180 tablets, from health stores) will help your liver remove these toxins, making weight control and tummy comfort more achievable.&#8217;</p>\n<h3>You might also like&#8230;</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-diets-flat-stomach-beat-bloating/control-article-cap-health-diets-flat-stomach-beat-bloating\" target=\"_blank\">Beat the bloat: your guide to a flat stomach</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/healthy-eating/ask-the-doctor-digestive-health-40504\" target=\"_blank\">Read our magazine doctors' advice on digestive problems</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/healthy-eating/dairy-wheat-free-made-easy-36934\" target=\"_blank\">How to eat wheat-free</a></p>","article_type_name":"Article (UK)","publish_date":"2012-09-06T13:48:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"3","import_ucid":null,"template_id":"19648","promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"15.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Unknown","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"uk-awyper","has_validation_error":"1","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article_uk","checked_out_ind":"0","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11778263","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":null,"editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-09-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1082","last_updated_date":"2012-09-08T15:32:29.000Z","author_id":"11239","contributor_first_name":null,"import_type_id":null,"contributor_state":null,"flow_id":"4","customer_id":null,"origin_site_prefix":"allaboutyou","contributor_country":null,"import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-17T04:00:00.000Z","origin_site_name":"All About You","import_region_id":null,"allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","canonical_url":"http://www.allaboutyou.com/health/health-advice/stomach-disorders-how-to-beat-tummy-troubles","issue_date":"","contributor_age":null,"contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"Always wanted to help at London Fashion Week?

When we finally got into the business in the late 90s we realized that Antonio had been largely forgotten. So for us it was really about loving Antonio&#146;s work and being very surprised that his legacy wasn&#146;t fully carried on to the fashion industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Mauricio Padilha:</strong> To be able to showcase the artwork, but also showcase what was going on in his life and the people he was hanging out with and things that really informed his artwork was really fascinating for us.</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>How did he influence the fashion industry?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MP:</strong> Some of the models, he wouldn&#146;t even put clothing on them. He would have the model standing next to the clothing in a leotard or whatever and he would illustrate how he saw the clothing onto the model&#146;s body. It became something different and a lot of times designers would go back and then rework their outfits so it looked more like his illustrations.</p>\n<p><strong>RP:</strong> We heard of women going to stores after seeing <em>New York Times</em> illustrations to purchase an outfit they saw in an Antonio and just being so horrified at what the reality of the outfit was.</p>\n<p><strong>MP:</strong> It&#146;s been said that YSL redid some of his collections just so that it mirrored more of what Antonio had drawn at the time.</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>He had this other side where he was not just an illustrator, but he was a connector.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RP:</strong> He discovered tons of models and people that would become some of the most famous faces of our time, like Jessica Lange, Jerry Hall and Grace Jones.</p>\n<p><strong>MP:</strong> Carole LaBrie was the first African American female to be on the cover of <em>Italian Vogue</em> and she was one of the models that he took to Paris. Then Andy Warhol put her in his movie <em>L&#146;Amour</em>. She was such a major model of her time and she broke ground and it was because of Antonio.</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>What are some of your favorite Antonio memories?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MP:</strong> Antonio would have to let off steam if he would get an illustrator's block. He would take Donna Jordan to Max's Kansas City and just dance with her for hours. Donna even said, \"One time I wasn't even dressed and he just told me to put my fur coat on and we went and danced for four to five hours. Then we went back to his apartment and he illustrated the most beautiful work he had ever done.\"</p>\n<p><strong>RP:</strong> One of the things that I always find amazing is the career launching, and one of them is Bill Cunningham. They became very goodfriends and Antonio said, \"If you&#146;re just going to hang out, why don&#146;t you take some pictures?\" And now we have this great icon in fashion known for his photographs.</p>\n<p><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>What would you say is his legacy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RP:</strong> There&#146;s so much about fashion nowadays that wouldn&#146;t be possible if it weren&#146;t for Antonio.

src=\"http://www.natmagnewsletters.co.uk/Newsletters/Menshealth/MHNew/stevesteak.jpg\" alt=\"Turning up the eat\" />\n<h2><br />Turning up the eat</h2>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Time to get serious &#150; about eating. I&#146;ve been doing this challenge for a month. The training <em>feels</em> like it&#146;s going really well. I&#146;m getting stronger and learning more than my little brain can absorb about my body, exercise form and biomechanics from my PT, Andy Vincent &#150; but I haven&#146;t been <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/food-nutrition/muscle-foods/philip-winchester-daily-diet?click=main_sr\" target=\"_blank\">piling on shirt-seam-bursting muscle</a> at the rate I&#146;d anticipated.</p> \n\n<p>Up to last week, from a starting point of 75kg, I&#146;d only put on about a kilo, despite having drastically cut down on cardio. Before the challenge I was running 30+ miles per week training for the <a href=\"http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">London Marathon</a>. Now I&#146;m down to eight miles or less. Nonetheless, my weight has remained pretty static.</p> \n\n<h2>In your face</h2> \n\n<p>The reason for this is right in my face. Or not, in fact. I&#146;m not eating enough. Andy gave me a nutrition plan at the start of the programme (see below), but, to be honest, I&#146;ve been rubbish at following it. I&#146;ve focused more on training than chomping, and clearly that balance needs to change. My assumption was that simply dropping cardio would be enough to miraculously convert thousands of newly unused calories into muscle. Unsurprisingly, this hasn&#146;t quite happened. As of yet, I simply haven&#146;t found the time, structure or motivation to fit in six meals a day, taking on 225g of protein (3g per kg of bodyweight) and at least 400g of carbs. That&#146;s a lot of food. Frankly, it requires a plan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mine is twofold:</strong></p> \n\n<p>1. Meat supplies. Instead of regular trips to the supermarket to buy potentially dubious quality meat, I&#146;m using a company called <a href=\" http://www.athleat.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Athleat</a>, which supplies pro athletes and sportsmen (and anyone else who needs it) with top quality fleshy fare. This takes the hassle out of trying to source the right meat at the right time &#150; and it&#146;s proving invaluable: beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, bison, crocodile... all delivered to my door in chilled packaging at the click of a button.</p>\n\n<p>2. Supplements. To support my protein and carb intake, I&#146;m taking Maximuscle Progain as a mid-morning snack and post-workout refuel (a 150g serving includes 40g of protein and 85g of carbs). And I&#146;m also using Maximuscle High Protein Promax as a more concentrated protein top-up when needed &#150; plus Promax Meal bars as required.</p>\n\n<h2>Fast results</h2>\n\n<p>A week into my new food regime and I&#146;m already seeing a change. My scales tipped 79kg for the first time ever this morning. That&#146;s not to say I&#146;ve put on 3kg in a week &#150; clearly your weight reading can fluctuate for various reasons &#150; but I have genuinely noticed results in only seven days. Which is pretty exciting.

A note with serious staying power, it lingered long after Josephine departed the premises, ensuring that her ex would be reminded of her every time he stepped foot into her abandoned chambers. Evidently, revenge is a dish best served heavily scented.</p>\n<p>That such a tale originates in France should come as no surprise, since, as French-Armenian fragrance maker Francis Kurkdjian puts it, \"Perfume is as much a part of the culture as food and wine; it's a part of life.\" French tradition involves taking young girls of 12 or 13 to shop for their very first perfume&#151;Kurkdjian remembers his sister's first bottle of Ana&#239;s Ana&#239;s by Cacharel&#151;and they grow up learning how to dab perfume on their pulse points: the neck, the wrists, behind the knees. Later in life, the ritual becomes \"part of seduction,\" explains Kurkdjian. \"It's very intimate.\"</p>\n<p>The French aren't afraid of their dark, spicy statement scents (think Guerlain Shalimar and Chanel No. 5), but as you move across southern Europe, Mediterranean freshness is de rigueur. Citrus and neroli are typical of the region, which has historically served as a melting pot&#151;the early days of Eastern spice traders and exotic travelers left a permanent mark on the fragrance culture. Take an island known for its fragrant orange blossom fields: As Sicily was invaded by the Romans and Arabs, cultures collided and their tastes intertwined over time, explains Sumit Bhasin, global leader of innovation for P&G Prestige, who helped create Dolce & Gabbana's latest scent, Pour Femme, a neroli-and-sandalwood-infused concoction that embodies the sweet and spicy notes of the area.</p>\n<p>In the Middle East, fragrance is so ingrained in the culture&#151;the Persians were the first to use distillation to extract oils from flowers&#151;that residents rarely go a day without it. Fragrance is often considered a spiritual way to anoint yourself before prayer, but it's also a personal statement: Many women wear strong perfume all over as a way to symbolize arrival, which is perhaps telling in areas where burkas are the local uniform. \"You almost greet people with how you smell,\" says Bhasin. Where smoldering incense and fragrant teas are ubiquitous, strong wood notes are popular&#151;earthy vetiver, sensual oud&#151;and there's a love of layering. Kurkdjian explains that women will apply a strong, woodsy base from a local perfumer, then layer flowery European perfumes on top. The technique is prevalent in India, too, where base notes like sandalwood and patchouli, used for centuries in religious and beautifying ceremonies, are mixed with sensual floral notes like jasmine.</p>","article_type_name":"Article","publish_date":"2012-09-05T15:00:00.000Z","partner_related_links_list_article":[],"import_chan_id":null,"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"promo_image_url":null,"total_rate":"0.00","allow_email_this":"1","version":"1","author_last_name":"Dunlop","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"avingan","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"in_this_issue_text":"","article_type_prefix":"article","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11745036","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a

I WAS IN BED</strong> with a guy whose sheets I'd wanted to get tangled up in for a while. It was our third date, but I was hoping for a thousand more, and we were having the kind of intense and passionate sex that makes you believe that might be possible. I felt so close to him with our eyes locked and our bodies bendy from red wine. But suddenly he pulled away and disappeared beneath the covers, diving headfirst between my thighs.</p>\n<p>\"I could do this forever,\" he said, his voice muffled by the blanket. All I could think was, <em>Please don't.</em></p>\n<p>Let me be clear: It's not that I hate oral sex. A tongue feels good anywhere it roams, and I'm not bothered by the fact that bodies don't exactly taste like cherry soda all the time. But oral sex demands total surrender to the moment and the person you're with. Unfortunately, I am often stuck in my own head. Instead of being lost in ecstasy, when a guy goes down on me, I'm worrying about loose hairs, whether or not his jaw is getting exhausted, and how I look down there. Or my mind wanders to things that have absolutely nothing to do with sex: I fret that I'm late with the cable bill or that I left the iron on. I worry that I will never reach orgasm, which usually ensures that I won't, because nothing detracts from erotic abandon like performance anxiety. All too often, receiving oral sex spirits me away from a universe of pleasure and into the troublesome territory of overeager den mother: <em>Are you sure you're OK down there? Do you need anything to drink? Would anyone like cookies?</em></p>\n<p>It's too bad I feel this way because the men I date seem happier than ever to go down on me. I figure it's a power thing. Decades of feminism and accessible porn have made women more comfortable with their bodies and more sexually aggressive, and guys may find it thrilling to make a woman vulnerable, to have her thighs trembling on either side of their face. It must be a huge rush to transform your partner into a puddle of id&#151;which I completely understand because that's how I feel when I go down on a guy. Don't get me wrong: Many women adore oral sex, and I consider it a sign of sexual progress that a man's oral skills now give him bragging rights.</p>\n<p>However, I'm not the only woman I know who feels ambivalence toward oral sex. When I asked female friends for their opinions, many gave less than stellar reviews: It takes too long. Guys don't know what they're doing. It requires a shower. One friend was obsessed with the notion that bits of mealy toilet paper could be stuck down there. Another simply said, \"Meh.\" And pop culture reflects our ambivalence. When television shows and books portray a woman receiving oral sex (and it's a rare occurrence), it's often clumsy and unfulfilled. Take the much-talked-about scene in the HBO show <em>Girls</em>, in which a sexually inexperienced character squirms while a guy goes down on her&#151;I can relate to that full-body cringe. Meanwhile, the heroine in <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> is so out of touch with her body that she doesn't masturbate, and the whole book reads like wish fulfillment for women unable to articulate what turns them on. Voil&#224;&#151;a best seller.</p>\n<p>In the end, the real trick to enjoying any sexual act is to know what you want and how to ask for it. So here is what I need: a dark room. Occasional giggles. Occasional quiet. A finger in the right spot helps. A vibrator can be fun. I've found that oral sex is not casual for me, which means that&#151;I'm sorry, sailor&#151;you can't show up at midnight, jump under the sheets, and expect to blow my mind. What I need more than anything is someone I trust and am comfortable with. Maybe that just won't happen by date number three. Till then, I'd prefer if my lovers kept their heads above the covers.</p>","publish_date":"2012-09-05T13:30:00.000Z","article_type_name":"Article","import_chan_id":null,"partner_related_links_list_article":[],"votes":"0","import_ucid":null,"template_id":null,"allow_email_this":"1","total_rate":"0.00","promo_image_url":null,"version":"1","author_last_name":"Hepola","source_creation_date":null,"last_updated_by":"avingan","has_validation_error":"0","contributor_last_name":null,"contributor_city":null,"article_type_prefix":"article","in_this_issue_text":"","checked_out_ind":"1","author_nick_name":null,"parent_id":null,"suppress_search":"0","mobile2_template_id":null,"id":"11714608","suppress_related_links":"0","related_links":"<a href=\"/world-reports/news/lynndie-england-1\">A Soldier's Tale: Lynndie England</a><br>\n<a href=\"/world-reports/news/geisha-school-russia\">Lessons in Love: The Millionaire Hunters</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/oral-sex-problems-for-women\">The Trouble With Oral Sex </a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sex-question-orgasm-problems\">Sex Advice : Help, I Can't Orgasm</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sex-question-allergy-semen\">Sex Advice : Are You Allergic to Semen?</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/best-sex-positions\">Sex Positions and Tips</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sleep-sex\">My Two Sex Lives</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sex-question-weight\">Sex Question: I'm Overweight</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sex-tips-pro\">Ultimate Sex Tips from the Pros</a><br>\n<a href=\"/sex-love/advice/sex-question-anal-sex\">The Lowdown on Anal Sex </a><br>\n","editorial_notes":null,"print_issue_date":"2012-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","allow_print_this":"1","article_type_id":"1","last_updated_date":"2013-02-09T17:34:34.000Z","author_id":"79058","contributor_first_name":null,"flow_id":"4","contributor_state":null,"import_type_id":null,"customer_id":null,"contributor_country":null,"origin_site_prefix":"marieclaire","import_author_id":null,"down_date":"2032-08-15T04:00:00.000Z","import_region_id":null,"origin_site_name":"Marie Claire","allow_archive":"1","allow_rate_this":"1","contributor_age":null,"issue_date":"","canonical_url":"http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/advice/oral-sex-problems-for-women","contributor_occupation":null},{"partner_related_links_list_breakfast":[],"promo_teaser":"My latest morning comrades could have a bit more staying power than this spring and summer's previous contestants;

Actually, that's not quite fair; I hate the time it takes to stop what I'm doing and fix something to eat for breakfast when I'm trying to catch a train, and I hate settling on an easy meal only to grow bored with it after a couple of weeks. (In the last few months alone, I've burned out on cereal, oatmeal, and scrambled eggs). I'm perpetually on the lookout for something new to grab as I juggle coffee and eyeliner and try to avoid the cats on the way out the door.

Each of the six varieties (Blueberry A&#231;ai, Cherry Almond, Toasted Coconut, Cranberry Almond, Apple & Honey, and Orchard Peach) contains seven grams of protein and five grams of fiber, clocks in at 170 calories or less, and has just six grams of fat (well, all but the Toasted Coconut, that is; sorry, coconut, but you're kind of fatty). Sugar-free they ain't, but given how well their combination of creamy probiotic yogurt (the bottom of each bar has a coating of it) and honey-roasted granola has been tiding me over for the first few hours of my day, I forgive them.
